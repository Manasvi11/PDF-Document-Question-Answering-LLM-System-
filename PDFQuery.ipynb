With the ever increasing amounts of data becoming\\navailable there is good reason to believe that smart data analysis will become\\neven more pervasive as a necessary ingredient for technological progress.\\nThe purpose of this chapter is to provide the reader with an overview over\\nthe vast range of applications which have at their heart a machine learning\\nproblem and to bring some degree of order to the zoo of problems. After\\nthat, we will discuss some basic tools from statistics and probability theory,\\nsince they form the language in which many machine learning problems must\\nbe phrased to become amenable to solving. Finally, we will outline a set of\\nfairly basic yet e\\x0bective algorithms to solve an important problem, namely\\nthat of classi\\x0ccation. More sophisticated tools, a discussion of more general\\nproblems and a detailed analysis will follow in later parts of the book.\\n1.1 A Taste of Machine Learning\\nMachine learning can appear in many guises. We now discuss a number of\\napplications, the types of data they deal with, and \\x0cnally, we formalize the\\nproblems in a somewhat more stylized fashion. The latter is key if we want to\\navoid reinventing the wheel for every new application. Instead, much of the\\nartof machine learning is to reduce a range of fairly disparate problems to\\na set of fairly narrow prototypes. Much of the science of machine learning is\\nthen to solve those problems and provide good guarantees for the solutions.\\n1.1.1 Applications\\nMost readers will be familiar with the concept of web page ranking . That\\nis, the process of submitting a query to a search engine, which then \\x0cnds\\nwebpages relevant to the query and which returns them in their order of\\nrelevance. See e.g. Figure 1.1 for an example of the query results for \\\\ma-\\nchine learning\". That is, the search engine returns a sorted list of webpages\\ngiven a query. To achieve this goal, a search engine needs to `know\\' which\\n34 1 Introduction\\nWeb Images Maps News Shopping Gmail more !

The 5 top scoring webpages for the query \\\\machine learning\"\\npages are relevant and which pages match the query. Such knowledge can be\\ngained from several sources: the link structure of webpages, their content,\\nthe frequency with which users will follow the suggested links in a query, or\\nfrom examples of queries in combination with manually ranked webpages.\\nIncreasingly machine learning rather than guesswork and clever engineering\\nis used to automate the process of designing a good search engine [RPB06].\\nA rather related application is collaborative \\x0cltering . Internet book-\\nstores such as Amazon, or video rental sites such as Net\\rix use this informa-\\ntion extensively to entice users to purchase additional goods (or rent more\\nmovies). The problem is quite similar to the one of web page ranking. As\\nbefore, we want to obtain a sorted list (in this case of articles). The key dif-\\nference is that an explicit query is missing and instead we can only use past\\npurchase and viewing decisions of the user to predict future viewing and\\npurchase habits. The key side information here are the decisions made by\\nsimilar users, hence the collaborative nature of the process. See Figure 1.2\\nfor an example. It is clearly desirable to have an automatic system to solve\\nthis problem, thereby avoiding guesswork and time [BK07].\\nAn equally ill-de\\x0cned problem is that of automatic translation of doc-\\numents. At one extreme, we could aim at fully understanding a text before\\ntranslating it using a curated set of rules crafted by a computational linguist\\nwell versed in the two languages we would like to translate. This is a rather\\narduous task, in particular given that text is not always grammatically cor-\\nrect, nor is the document understanding part itself a trivial one. Instead, we\\ncould simply use examples of translated documents, such as the proceedings\\nof the Canadian parliament or other multilingual entities (United Nations,\\nEuropean Union, Switzerland) to learn how to translate between the two1.1 A Taste of Machine Learning 5\\nlanguages. In other words, we could use examples of translations to learn\\nhow to translate. This machine learning approach proved quite successful\\n[?].\\nMany security applications, e.g. for access control, use face recognition as\\none of its components. That is, given the photo (or video recording) of a\\nperson, recognize who this person is. In other words, the system needs to\\nclassify the faces into one of many categories (Alice, Bob, Charlie, . . . ) or\\ndecide that it is an unknown face. A similar, yet conceptually quite di\\x0berent\\nproblem is that of veri\\x0ccation. Here the goal is to verify whether the person\\nin question is who he claims to be. Note that di\\x0berently to before, this\\nis now a yes/no question. To deal with di\\x0berent lighting conditions, facial\\nexpressions, whether a person is wearing glasses, hairstyle, etc., it is desirable\\nto have a system which learns which features are relevant for identifying a\\nperson.\\nAnother application where learning helps is the problem of named entity\\nrecognition (see Figure 1.4). That is, the problem of identifying entities,\\nsuch as places, titles, names, actions, etc. from documents. Such steps are\\ncrucial in the automatic digestion and understanding of documents. Some\\nmodern e-mail clients, such as Apple\\'s Mail.app nowadays ship with the\\nability to identify addresses in mails and \\x0cling them automatically in an\\naddress book. While systems using hand-crafted rules can lead to satisfac-\\ntory results, it is far more e\\x0ecient to use examples of marked-up documents\\nto learn such dependencies automatically, in particular if we want to de-\\nploy our system in many languages.

The average college senior typicallyknows very little about subjects like neural networks, genetic algorithms, or Baysiannetworks, and this book goes a long way in demystifying these subjects in a veryclear, concise, and understandable way. Moreover, the first-year grad. student who isinterested in possibly doing research in this field needs more of an overview than todive deeply into one of the many branches which themselves have had entire books written aboutthem. This is one of the few if only books where one will find diverse areas oflearning (e.g. analytical, reinforcment, Bayesian, neural-network, genetic-algorithmic)all within the same cover.But more than just an encyclopedic introduction, the author makes a number ofconnections between the different paradigms. For example, he explains thatassociated with each paradigm is the notion of an inductive-learning bias, i.e. theunderlying assumptions that lend validity to a given learning approach. These end-of-chapter discussions on bias seem very interesting and unique to this book.Finally, I used this book for part of the reading material for an intro. AI class, andreceived much positive feedback from the students, although some did find thepresentation a bit too abstract for their undergraduate tastes\\n Comment | Permalink | Was this review helpful to you?  \\n (Report this)  22 of 27 people found the following review helpful:\\n Great compilation, May 18, 2001By Steven Burns (-) - See all my reviewsThis review is from: Machine Learning (Hardcover)This book is completely worth the price, and worth the hardcover to take care of it.The main chapters of the book are independent, so you can read them in any order.The way it explains the different learning approaches is beautiful because: 1)itexplains them nicely 2)it gives examples and 3)it presents pseudocode summaries ofthe algorithms.

I found the 2nd edition ofRussell and Norvig to be a better introduction where it covers the same topic, whichit does for everything I can think of, except VC dimension.The book sorely needs an update, it was written in 1997 and the field has movedfast. A comparison with Mitchell\\'s current course (materials generously availableonline) shows that about 1/4 of the topics taught have arisen since the book waspublished; Boosting, Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov Models to namethe best-known. The book also does not cover statistical or data mining methods.Despite the subjective complaint about lack of depth it does give the theoreticalroots and many fundamental techniques decently and readably.

The relevant\\nlocations, organizations and persons are tagged for further information extraction.\\nare clearly terms from agriculture, it is equally clear that in the context of\\ncontemporary politics they refer to members of the Republican Party.\\nOther applications which take advantage of learning are speech recog-\\nnition (annotate an audio sequence with text, such as the system shipping\\nwith Microsoft Vista), the recognition of handwriting (annotate a sequence\\nof strokes with text, a feature common to many PDAs), trackpads of com-\\nputers (e.g. Synaptics, a major manufacturer of such pads derives its name\\nfrom the synapses of a neural network), the detection of failure in jet en-\\ngines, avatar behavior in computer games (e.g. Black and White), direct\\nmarketing (companies use past purchase behavior to guesstimate whether\\nyou might be willing to purchase even more) and \\roor cleaning robots (such\\nas iRobot\\'s Roomba). The overarching theme of learning problems is that\\nthere exists a nontrivial dependence between some observations, which we\\nwill commonly refer to as xand a desired response, which we refer to as y,\\nfor which a simple set of deterministic rules is not known. By using learning\\nwe can infer such a dependency between xandyin a systematic fashion.\\nWe conclude this section by discussing the problem of classi\\x0ccation ,\\nsince it will serve as a prototypical problem for a signi\\x0ccant part of this\\nbook. It occurs frequently in practice: for instance, when performing spam\\n\\x0cltering, we are interested in a yes/no answer as to whether an e-mail con-\\ntains relevant information or not. Note that this issue is quite user depen-\\ndent: for a frequent traveller e-mails from an airline informing him about\\nrecent discounts might prove valuable information, whereas for many other\\nrecipients this might prove more of an nuisance (e.g. when the e-mail relates\\nto products available only overseas). Moreover, the nature of annoying e-\\nmails might change over time, e.g. through the availability of new products\\n(Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, . . . ), di\\x0berent opportunities for fraud (the Nigerian\\n419 scam which took a new twist after the Iraq war), or di\\x0berent data types\\n(e.g. spam which consists mainly of images). To combat these problems we1.1 A Taste of Machine Learning 7\\nFig. 1.5. Binary classi\\x0ccation; separate stars from diamonds. In this example we\\nare able to do so by drawing a straight line which separates both sets. We will see\\nlater that this is an important example of what is called a linear classi\\x0cer .\\nwant to build a system which is able to learn how to classify new e-mails.\\nA seemingly unrelated problem, that of cancer diagnosis shares a common\\nstructure: given histological data (e.g. from a microarray analysis of a pa-\\ntient\\'s tissue) infer whether a patient is healthy or not. Again, we are asked\\nto generate a yes/no answer given a set of observations. See Figure 1.5 for\\nan example.\\n1.1.2 Data\\nIt is useful to characterize learning problems according to the type of data\\nthey use. This is a great help when encountering new challenges, since quite\\noften problems on similar data types can be solved with very similar tech-\\nniques. For instance natural language processing and bioinformatics use very\\nsimilar tools for strings of natural language text and for DNA sequences.\\nVectors constitute the most basic entity we might encounter in our work.\\nFor instance, a life insurance company might be interesting in obtaining the\\nvector of variables (blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, cholesterol\\nlevel, smoker, gender) to infer the life expectancy of a potential customer.\\nA farmer might be interested in determining the ripeness of fruit based on\\n(size, weight, spectral data). An engineer might want to \\x0cnd dependencies\\nin (voltage, current) pairs. Likewise one might want to represent documents\\nby a vector of counts which describe the occurrence of words. The latter is\\ncommonly referred to as bag of words features.\\nOne of the challenges in dealing with vectors is that the scales and units\\nof di\\x0berent coordinates may vary widely. For instance, we could measure the\\nheight in kilograms, pounds, grams, tons, stones, all of which would amount\\nto multiplicative changes. Likewise, when representing temperatures, we\\nhave a full class of a\\x0ene transformations, depending on whether we rep-\\nresent them in terms of Celsius, Kelvin or Farenheit. One way of dealing8 1 Introduction\\nwith those issues in an automatic fashion is to normalize the data. We will\\ndiscuss means of doing so in an automatic fashion.\\nLists: In some cases the vectors we obtain may contain a variable number\\nof features. For instance, a physician might not necessarily decide to perform\\na full battery of diagnostic tests if the patient appears to be healthy.\\nSets may appear in learning problems whenever there is a large number of\\npotential causes of an e\\x0bect, which are not well determined. For instance, it is\\nrelatively easy to obtain data concerning the toxicity of mushrooms. It would\\nbe desirable to use such data to infer the toxicity of a new mushroom given\\ninformation about its chemical compounds. However, mushrooms contain a\\ncocktail of compounds out of which one or more may be toxic. Consequently\\nwe need to infer the properties of an object given a setof features, whose\\ncomposition and number may vary considerably.\\nMatrices are a convenient means of representing pairwise relationships.\\nFor instance, in collaborative \\x0cltering applications the rows of the matrix\\nmay represent users whereas the columns correspond to products. Only in\\nsome cases we will have knowledge about a given (user, product) combina-\\ntion, such as the rating of the product by a user.\\nA related situation occurs whenever we only have similarity information\\nbetween observations, as implemented by a semi-empirical distance mea-\\nsure. Some homology searches in bioinformatics, e.g. variants of BLAST\\n[AGML90], only return a similarity score which does not necessarily satisfy\\nthe requirements of a metric.\\nImages could be thought of as two dimensional arrays of numbers, that is,\\nmatrices. This representation is very crude, though, since they exhibit spa-\\ntial coherence (lines, shapes) and (natural images exhibit) a multiresolution\\nstructure. That is, downsampling an image leads to an object which has very\\nsimilar statistics to the original image. Computer vision and psychooptics\\nhave created a raft of tools for describing these phenomena.\\nVideo adds a temporal dimension to images. Again, we could represent\\nthem as a three dimensional array. Good algorithms, however, take the tem-\\nporal coherence of the image sequence into account.\\nTrees and Graphs are often used to describe relations between collec-\\ntions of objects. For instance the ontology of webpages of the DMOZ project\\n(www.dmoz.org ) has the form of a tree with topics becoming increasingly\\nre\\x0cned as we traverse from the root to one of the leaves (Arts !Animation\\n!Anime!General Fan Pages !O\\x0ecial Sites). In the case of gene ontol-\\nogy the relationships form a directed acyclic graph, also referred to as the\\nGO-DAG [ABB+00].\\nBoth examples above describe estimation problems where our observations1.1 A Taste of Machine Learning 9\\nare vertices of a tree or graph. However, graphs themselves may be the\\nobservations. For instance, the DOM-tree of a webpage, the call-graph of\\na computer program, or the protein-protein interaction networks may form\\nthe basis upon which we may want to perform inference.\\nStrings occur frequently, mainly in the area of bioinformatics and natural\\nlanguage processing. They may be the input to our estimation problems, e.g.\\nwhen classifying an e-mail as spam, when attempting to locate all names of\\npersons and organizations in a text, or when modeling the topic structure\\nof a document. Equally well they may constitute the output of a system.\\nFor instance, we may want to perform document summarization, automatic\\ntranslation, or attempt to answer natural language queries.\\nCompound structures are the most commonly occurring object. That\\nis, in most situations we will have a structured mix of di\\x0berent data types.\\nFor instance, a webpage might contain images, text, tables, which in turn\\ncontain numbers, and lists, all of which might constitute nodes on a graph of\\nwebpages linked among each other. Good statistical modelling takes such de-\\npendencies and structures into account in order to tailor su\\x0eciently \\rexible\\nmodels.\\n1.1.3 Problems\\nThe range of learning problems is clearly large, as we saw when discussing\\napplications. That said, researchers have identi\\x0ced an ever growing number\\nof templates which can be used to address a large set of situations. It is those\\ntemplates which make deployment of machine learning in practice easy and\\nour discussion will largely focus on a choice set of such problems. We now\\ngive a by no means complete list of templates.\\nBinary Classi\\x0ccation is probably the most frequently studied problem\\nin machine learning and it has led to a large number of important algorithmic\\nand theoretic developments over the past century. In its simplest form it\\nreduces to the question: given a pattern xdrawn from a domain X, estimate\\nwhich value an associated binary random variable y2f\\x06 1gwill assume.\\nFor instance, given pictures of apples and oranges, we might want to state\\nwhether the object in question is an apple or an orange. Equally well, we\\nmight want to predict whether a home owner might default on his loan,\\ngiven income data, his credit history, or whether a given e-mail is spam or\\nham. The ability to solve this basic problem already allows us to address a\\nlarge variety of practical settings.\\nThere are many variants exist with regard to the protocol in which we are\\nrequired to make our estimation:10 1 Introduction\\nFig. 1.6. Left: binary classi\\x0ccation. Right: 3-class classi\\x0ccation. Note that in the\\nlatter case we have much more degree for ambiguity. For instance, being able to\\ndistinguish stars from diamonds may not su\\x0ece to identify either of them correctly,\\nsince we also need to distinguish both of them from triangles.\\n\\x0fWe might see a sequence of ( xi;yi) pairs for which yineeds to be estimated\\nin an instantaneous online fashion. This is commonly referred to as online\\nlearning.\\n\\x0fWe might observe a collection X:=fx1;:::xmgandY:=fy1;:::ymgof\\npairs (xi;yi) which are then used to estimate yfor a (set of) so-far unseen\\nX0=\\x08\\nx0\\n1;:::;x0\\nm0\\t\\n. This is commonly referred to as batch learning.\\n\\x0fWe might be allowed to know X0already at the time of constructing the\\nmodel. This is commonly referred to as transduction.\\n\\x0fWe might be allowed to choose Xfor the purpose of model building. This\\nis known as active learning.\\n\\x0fWe might not have full information about X, e.g. some of the coordinates\\nof theximight be missing, leading to the problem of estimation with\\nmissing variables.\\n\\x0fThe sets XandX0might come from di\\x0berent data sources, leading to the\\nproblem of covariate shift correction.\\n\\x0fWe might be given observations stemming from two problems at the same\\ntime with the side information that both problems are somehow related.\\nThis is known as co-training.\\n\\x0fMistakes of estimation might be penalized di\\x0berently depending on the\\ntype of error, e.g. when trying to distinguish diamonds from rocks a very\\nasymmetric loss applies.\\nMulticlass Classi\\x0ccation is the logical extension of binary classi\\x0cca-\\ntion. The main di\\x0berence is that now y2f1;:::;ngmay assume a range\\nof di\\x0berent values. For instance, we might want to classify a document ac-\\ncording to the language it was written in (English, French, German, Spanish,\\nHindi, Japanese, Chinese, . . . ). See Figure 1.6 for an example. The main dif-\\nference to before is that the cost of error may heavily depend on the type of1.1 A Taste of Machine Learning 11\\nFig. 1.7. Regression estimation. We are given a number of instances (indicated by\\nblack dots) and would like to \\x0cnd some function fmapping the observations Xto\\nRsuch thatf(x) is close to the observed values.\\nerror we make. For instance, in the problem of assessing the risk of cancer, it\\nmakes a signi\\x0ccant di\\x0berence whether we mis-classify an early stage of can-\\ncer as healthy (in which case the patient is likely to die) or as an advanced\\nstage of cancer (in which case the patient is likely to be inconvenienced from\\noverly aggressive treatment).\\nStructured Estimation goes beyond simple multiclass estimation by\\nassuming that the labels yhave some additional structure which can be used\\nin the estimation process. For instance, ymight be a path in an ontology,\\nwhen attempting to classify webpages, ymight be a permutation, when\\nattempting to match objects, to perform collaborative \\x0cltering, or to rank\\ndocuments in a retrieval setting. Equally well, ymight be an annotation of\\na text, when performing named entity recognition. Each of those problems\\nhas its own properties in terms of the set of ywhich we might consider\\nadmissible, or how to search this space. We will discuss a number of those\\nproblems in Chapter ??.\\nRegression is another prototypical application. Here the goal is to esti-\\nmate a real-valued variable y2Rgiven a pattern x(see e.g. Figure 1.7). For\\ninstance, we might want to estimate the value of a stock the next day, the\\nyield of a semiconductor fab given the current process, the iron content of\\nore given mass spectroscopy measurements, or the heart rate of an athlete,\\ngiven accelerometer data. One of the key issues in which regression problems\\ndi\\x0ber from each other is the choice of a loss. For instance, when estimating\\nstock values our loss for a put option will be decidedly one-sided. On the\\nother hand, a hobby athlete might only care that our estimate of the heart\\nrate matches the actual on average.\\nNovelty Detection is a rather ill-de\\x0cned problem. It describes the issue\\nof determining \\\\unusual\" observations given a set of past measurements.\\nClearly, the choice of what is to be considered unusual is very subjective.\\nA commonly accepted notion is that unusual events occur rarely. Hence a\\npossible goal is to design a system which assigns to each observation a rating12 1 Introduction\\nFig. 1.8. Left: typical digits contained in the database of the US Postal Service.\\nRight: unusual digits found by a novelty detection algorithm [SPST+01] (for a\\ndescription of the algorithm see Section 7.4). The score below the digits indicates\\nthe degree of novelty. The numbers on the lower right indicate the class associated\\nwith the digit.\\nas to how novel it is. Readers familiar with density estimation might contend\\nthat the latter would be a reasonable solution. However, we neither need a\\nscore which sums up to 1 on the entire domain, nor do we care particularly\\nmuch about novelty scores for typical observations. We will later see how this\\nsomewhat easier goal can be achieved directly. Figure 1.8 has an example of\\nnovelty detection when applied to an optical character recognition database.\\n1.2 Probability Theory\\nIn order to deal with the instances of where machine learning can be used, we\\nneed to develop an adequate language which is able to describe the problems\\nconcisely. Below we begin with a fairly informal overview over probability\\ntheory. For more details and a very gentle and detailed discussion see the\\nexcellent book of [BT03].\\n1.2.1 Random Variables\\nAssume that we cast a dice and we would like to know our chances whether\\nwe would see 1 rather than another digit. If the dice is fair all six outcomes\\nX=f1;:::; 6gare equally likely to occur, hence we would see a 1 in roughly\\n1 out of 6 cases. Probability theory allows us to model uncertainty in the out-\\ncome of such experiments. Formally we state that 1 occurs with probability\\n1\\n6.\\nIn many experiments, such as the roll of a dice, the outcomes are of a\\nnumerical nature and we can handle them easily. In other cases, the outcomes\\nmay not be numerical, e.g., if we toss a coin and observe heads or tails. In\\nthese cases, it is useful to associate numerical values to the outcomes. This\\nis done via a random variable. For instance, we can let a random variable1.2 Probability Theory 13\\nXtake on a value +1 whenever the coin lands heads and a value of \\x001\\notherwise. Our notational convention will be to use uppercase letters, e.g.,\\nX,Yetc to denote random variables and lower case letters, e.g.,x,yetc to\\ndenote the values they take.\\nXweightheightξ(x)x\\nFig. 1.9. The random variable \\x18maps from the set of outcomes of an experiment\\n(denoted here by X) to real numbers. As an illustration here Xconsists of the\\npatients a physician might encounter, and they are mapped via \\x18to their weight\\nand height.\\n1.2.2 Distributions\\nPerhaps the most important way to characterize a random variable is to\\nassociate probabilities with the values it can take. If the random variable is\\ndiscrete, i.e.,it takes on a \\x0cnite number of values, then this assignment of\\nprobabilities is called a probability mass function or PMF for short. A PMF\\nmust be, by de\\x0cnition, non-negative and must sum to one. For instance,\\nif the coin is fair, i.e., heads and tails are equally likely, then the random\\nvariableXdescribed above takes on values of +1 and \\x001 with probability\\n0:5. This can be written as\\nPr(X= +1) = 0:5 andPr(X=\\x001) = 0:5: (1.1)\\nWhen there is no danger of confusion we will use the slightly informal no-\\ntationp(x) :=Pr(X=x).\\nIn case of a continuous random variable the assignment of probabilities\\nresults in a probability density function or PDF for short. With some abuse\\nof terminology, but keeping in line with convention, we will often use density\\nor distribution instead of probability density function. As in the case of the\\nPMF, a PDF must also be non-negative and integrate to one. Figure 1.10\\nshows two distributions: the uniform distribution\\np(x) =(\\n1\\nb\\x00aifx2[a;b]\\n0 otherwise ;(1.2)14 1 Introduction\\n-4\\n -2\\n 0\\n 2\\n 4\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n-4\\n -2\\n 0\\n 2\\n 4\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\nFig. 1.10.

They are called the quantiles of the distribution p.\\nDe\\x0cnition 1.2 (Quantiles) Letq2(0;1). Then the value of x0for which\\nPr(X <x0)\\x14qandPr(X >x0)\\x141\\x00qis theq-quantile of the distribution\\np. Moreover, the value x0associated with q= 0:5is called the median.1.2 Probability Theory 15\\np(x)\\nFig. 1.11. Quantiles of a distribution correspond to the area under the integral of\\nthe density p(x) for which the integral takes on a pre-speci\\x0ced value. Illustrated\\nare the 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 quantiles respectively.\\n1.2.3 Mean and Variance\\nA common question to ask about a random variable is what its expected\\nvalue might be. For instance, when measuring the voltage of a device, we\\nmight ask what its typical values might be. When deciding whether to ad-\\nminister a growth hormone to a child a doctor might ask what a sensible\\nrange of height should be. For those purposes we need to de\\x0cne expectations\\nand related quantities of distributions.\\nDe\\x0cnition 1.3 (Mean) We de\\x0cne the mean of a random variable Xas\\nE[X] :=Z\\nxdp(x) (1.6)\\nMore generally, if f:R!Ris a function, then f(X)is also a random\\nvariable. Its mean is mean given by\\nE[f(X)] :=Z\\nf(x)dp(x): (1.7)\\nWheneverXis a discrete random variable the integral in (1.6) can be re-\\nplaced by a summation:\\nE[X] =X\\nxxp(x): (1.8)\\nFor instance, in the case of a dice we have equal probabilities of 1 =6 for all\\n6 possible outcomes. It is easy to see that this translates into a mean of\\n(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) =6 = 3:5.\\nThe mean of a random variable is useful in assessing expected losses and\\nbene\\x0cts. For instance, as a stock broker we might be interested in the ex-\\npected value of our investment in a year\\'s time. In addition to that, however,\\nwe also might want to investigate the riskof our investment. That is, how\\nlikely it is that the value of the investment might deviate from its expecta-\\ntion since this might be more relevant for our decisions. This means that we16 1 Introduction\\nneed a variable to quantify the risk inherent in a random variable. One such\\nmeasure is the variance of a random variable.\\nDe\\x0cnition 1.4 (Variance) We de\\x0cne the variance of a random variable\\nXas\\nVar[X] :=Eh\\n(X\\x00E[X])2i\\n: (1.9)\\nAs before, if f:R!Ris a function, then the variance of f(X)is given by\\nVar[f(X)] :=Eh\\n(f(X)\\x00E[f(X)])2i\\n: (1.10)\\nThe variance measures by how much on average f(X) deviates from its ex-\\npected value. As we shall see in Section 2.1, an upper bound on the variance\\ncan be used to give guarantees on the probability that f(X) will be within\\n\\x0fof its expected value. This is one of the reasons why the variance is often\\nassociated with the risk of a random variable. Note that often one discusses\\nproperties of a random variable in terms of its standard deviation , which is\\nde\\x0cned as the square root of the variance.\\n1.2.4 Marginalization, Independence, Conditioning, and Bayes\\nRule\\nGiven two random variables XandY, one can write their joint density\\np(x;y). Given the joint density, one can recover p(x) by integrating out y.\\nThis operation is called marginalization:\\np(x) =Z\\nydp(x;y): (1.11)\\nIfYis a discrete random variable, then we can replace the integration with\\na summation:\\np(x) =X\\nyp(x;y): (1.12)\\nWe say that XandYare independent, i.e.,the values that Xtakes does\\nnot depend on the values that Ytakes whenever\\np(x;y) =p(x)p(y): (1.13)\\nIndependence is useful when it comes to dealing with large numbers of ran-\\ndom variables whose behavior we want to estimate jointly. For instance,\\nwhenever we perform repeated measurements of a quantity, such as when1.2 Probability Theory 17\\n-0.5\\n 0.0\\n 0.5\\n 1.0\\n 1.5 2.0-0.5\\n0.0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n1.52.0\\n-0.5\\n 0.0\\n 0.5\\n 1.0\\n 1.5 2.0-0.5\\n0.0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n1.52.0\\nFig. 1.12. Left: a sample from two dependent random variables. Knowing about\\n\\x0crst coordinate allows us to improve our guess about the second coordinate. Right:\\na sample drawn from two independent random variables, obtained by randomly\\npermuting the dependent sample.\\nmeasuring the voltage of a device, we will typically assume that the individ-\\nual measurements are drawn from the same distribution and that they are\\nindependent of each other. That is, having measured the voltage a number\\nof times will not a\\x0bect the value of the next measurement. We will call such\\nrandom variables to be independently and identically distributed , or in short,\\niidrandom variables. See Figure 1.12 for an example of a pair of random\\nvariables drawn from dependent and independent distributions respectively.\\nConversely, dependence can be vital in classi\\x0ccation and regression prob-\\nlems. For instance, the tra\\x0ec lights at an intersection are dependent of each\\nother. This allows a driver to perform the inference that when the lights are\\ngreen in his direction there will be no tra\\x0ec crossing his path, i.e. the other\\nlights will indeed be red. Likewise, whenever we are given a picture xof a\\ndigit, we hope that there will be dependence between xand its label y.\\nEspecially in the case of dependent random variables, we are interested\\nin conditional probabilities, i.e., probability that Xtakes on a particular\\nvalue given the value of Y. ClearlyPr(X=rainjY=cloudy ) is higher than\\nPr(X=rainjY=sunny ). In other words, knowledge about the value of Y\\nsigni\\x0ccantly in\\ruences the distribution of X. This is captured via conditional\\nprobabilities:\\np(xjy) :=p(x;y)\\np(y): (1.14)\\nEquation 1.14 leads to one of the key tools in statistical inference.\\nTheorem 1.5 (Bayes Rule) Denote byXandYrandom variables then18 1 Introduction\\nthe following holds\\np(yjx) =p(xjy)p(y)\\np(x): (1.15)\\nThis follows from the fact that p(x;y) =p(xjy)p(y) =p(yjx)p(x). The key\\nconsequence of (1.15) is that we may reverse the conditioning between a\\npair of random variables.\\n1.2.4.1 An Example\\nWe illustrate our reasoning by means of a simple example | inference using\\nan AIDS test. Assume that a patient would like to have such a test carried\\nout on him. The physician recommends a test which is guaranteed to detect\\nHIV-positive whenever a patient is infected. On the other hand, for healthy\\npatients it has a 1% error rate. That is, with probability 0.01 it diagnoses\\na patient as HIV-positive even when he is, in fact, HIV-negative. Moreover,\\nassume that 0.15% of the population is infected.\\nNow assume that the patient has the test carried out and the test re-\\nturns \\'HIV-negative\\'. In this case, logic implies that he is healthy, since the\\ntest has 100% detection rate. In the converse case things are not quite as\\nstraightforward. Denote by XandTthe random variables associated with\\nthe health status of the patient and the outcome of the test respectively. We\\nare interested in p(X= HIV+jT= HIV+). By Bayes rule we may write\\np(X= HIV+jT= HIV+) =p(T= HIV+jX= HIV+)p(X= HIV+)\\np(T= HIV+)\\nWhile we know all terms in the numerator, p(T= HIV+) itself is unknown.\\nThat said, it can be computed via\\np(T= HIV+) =X\\nx2fHIV+;HIV-gp(T= HIV+;x)\\n=X\\nx2fHIV+;HIV-gp(T= HIV+jx)p(x)\\n= 1:0\\x010:0015 + 0:01\\x010:9985:\\nSubstituting back into the conditional expression yields\\np(X= HIV+jT= HIV+) =1:0\\x010:0015\\n1:0\\x010:0015 + 0:01\\x010:9985= 0:1306:\\nIn other words, even though our test is quite reliable, there is such a low\\nprior probability of having been infected with AIDS that there is not much\\nevidence to accept the hypothesis even after this test.1.2 Probability Theory 19\\nagextest 1test 2\\nFig. 1.13. A graphical description of our HIV testing scenario. Knowing the age of\\nthe patient in\\ruences our prior on whether the patient is HIV positive (the random\\nvariableX). The outcomes of the tests 1 and 2 are independent of each other given\\nthe statusX. We observe the shaded random variables (age, test 1, test 2) and\\nwould like to infer the un-shaded random variable X. This is a special case of a\\ngraphical model which we will discuss in Chapter ??.\\nLet us now think how we could improve the diagnosis. One way is to ob-\\ntain further information about the patient and to use this in the diagnosis.\\nFor instance, information about his age is quite useful. Suppose the patient\\nis 35 years old. In this case we would want to compute p(X= HIV+jT=\\nHIV+;A= 35) where the random variable Adenotes the age. The corre-\\nsponding expression yields:\\np(T= HIV+jX= HIV+;A)p(X= HIV+jA)\\np(T= HIV+jA)\\nHere we simply conditioned all random variables on Ain order to take addi-\\ntional information into account. We may assume that the test is independent\\nof the age of the patient, i.e.\\np(tjx;a) =p(tjx):\\nWhat remains therefore is p(X= HIV+jA). Recent US census data pegs this\\nnumber at approximately 0.9%. Plugging all data back into the conditional\\nexpression yields1\\x010:009\\n1\\x010:009+0:01\\x010:991= 0:48. What has happened here is that\\nby including additional observed random variables our estimate has become\\nmore reliable. Combination of evidence is a powerful tool. In our case it\\nhelped us make the classi\\x0ccation problem of whether the patient is HIV-\\npositive or not more reliable.\\nA second tool in our arsenal is the use of multiple measurements. After\\nthe \\x0crst test the physician is likely to carry out a second test to con\\x0crm the\\ndiagnosis. We denote by T1andT2(andt1;t2respectively) the two tests.\\nObviously, what we want is that T2will give us an \\\\independent\" second\\nopinion of the situation. In other words, we want to ensure that T2does\\nnot make the same mistakes as T1. For instance, it is probably a bad idea\\nto repeatT1without changes, since it might perform the same diagnostic20 1 Introduction\\nmistake as before. What we want is that the diagnosis of T2is independent\\nof that ofT2given the health status Xof the patient. This is expressed as\\np(t1;t2jx) =p(t1jx)p(t2jx): (1.16)\\nSee Figure 1.13 for a graphical illustration of the setting. Random variables\\nsatisfying the condition (1.16) are commonly referred to as conditionally\\nindependent . In shorthand we write T1;T2? ?X. For the sake of the argument\\nwe assume that the statistics for T2are given by\\np(t2jx)x= HIV-x= HIV+\\nt2= HIV- 0.95 0.01\\nt2= HIV+ 0.05 0.99\\nClearly this test is less reliable than the \\x0crst one. However, we may now\\ncombine both estimates to obtain a very reliable estimate based on the\\ncombination of both events. For instance, for t1=t2= HIV+ we have\\np(X= HIV+jT1= HIV+;T2= HIV+) =1:0\\x010:99\\x010:009\\n1:0\\x010:99\\x010:009 + 0:01\\x010:05\\x010:991= 0:95:\\nIn other words, by combining two tests we can now con\\x0crm with very high\\ncon\\x0cdence that the patient is indeed diseased. What we have carried out is a\\ncombination of evidence. Strong experimental evidence of two positive tests\\ne\\x0bectively overcame an initially very strong prior which suggested that the\\npatient might be healthy.\\nTests such as in the example we just discussed are fairly common. For\\ninstance, we might need to decide which manufacturing procedure is prefer-\\nable, which choice of parameters will give better results in a regression es-\\ntimator, or whether to administer a certain drug. Note that often our tests\\nmay not be conditionally independent and we would need to take this into\\naccount.\\n1.3 Basic Algorithms\\nWe conclude our introduction to machine learning by discussing four simple\\nalgorithms, namely Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbors, the Mean Classi\\x0cer,\\nand the Perceptron, which can be used to solve a binary classi\\x0ccation prob-\\nlem such as that described in Figure 1.5. We will also introduce the K-means\\nalgorithm which can be employed when labeled data is not available. All\\nthese algorithms are readily usable and easily implemented from scratch in\\ntheir most basic form.\\nFor the sake of concreteness assume that we are interested in spam \\x0clter-\\ning.

The key assumption we make here is that the pairs\\n(xi;yi) are drawn jointly from some distribution p(x;y) which represents\\nthe e-mail generating process for a user. Moreover, we assume that there\\nis su\\x0eciently strong dependence between xandythat we will be able to\\nestimateygivenxand a set of labeled instances X;Y.\\nBefore we do so we need to address the fact that e-mails such as Figure 1.14\\naretext, whereas the three algorithms we present will require data to be\\nrepresented in a vectorial fashion. One way of converting text into a vector\\nis by using the so-called bag of words representation [Mar61, Lew98]. In its\\nsimplest version it works as follows: Assume we have a list of all possible\\nwords occurring in X, that is a dictionary, then we are able to assign a unique\\nnumber with each of those words (e.g. the position in the dictionary). Now\\nwe may simply count for each document xithe number of times a given\\nwordjis occurring. This is then used as the value of the j-th coordinate\\nofxi. Figure 1.15 gives an example of such a representation. Once we have\\nthe latter it is easy to compute distances, similarities, and other statistics\\ndirectly from the vectorial representation.22 1 Introduction\\n1.3.1 Naive Bayes\\nIn the example of the AIDS test we used the outcomes of the test to infer\\nwhether the patient is diseased. In the context of spam \\x0cltering the actual\\ntext of the e-mail xcorresponds to the test and the label yis equivalent to\\nthe diagnosis. Recall Bayes Rule (1.15). We could use the latter to infer\\np(yjx) =p(xjy)p(y)\\np(x):\\nWe may have a good estimate of p(y), that is, the probability of receiving\\na spam or ham mail. Denote by mhamandmspam the number of ham and\\nspam e-mails in X. In this case we can estimate\\np(ham)\\x19mham\\nmandp(spam)\\x19mspam\\nm:\\nThe key problem, however, is that we do not know p(xjy) orp(x). We may\\ndispose of the requirement of knowing p(x) by settling for a likelihood ratio\\nL(x) :=p(spamjx)\\np(hamjx)=p(xjspam)p(spam)\\np(xjham)p(ham): (1.17)\\nWheneverL(x) exceeds a given threshold cwe decide that xis spam and\\nconsequently reject the e-mail. If cis large then our algorithm is conservative\\nand classi\\x0ces an email as spam only if p(spamjx)\\x1dp(hamjx). On the other\\nhand, ifcis small then the algorithm aggressively classi\\x0ces emails as spam.\\nThe key obstacle is that we have no access to p(xjy). This is where we make\\nour key approximation. Recall Figure 1.13. In order to model the distribution\\nof the test outcomes T1andT2we made the assumption that they are\\nconditionally independent of each other given the diagnosis. Analogously,\\nwe may now treat the occurrence of each word in a document as a separate\\ntest and combine the outcomes in a naive fashion by assuming that\\np(xjy) =# of words in xY\\nj=1p(wjjy); (1.18)\\nwherewjdenotes the j-th word in document x. This amounts to the as-\\nsumption that the probability of occurrence of a word in a document is\\nindependent of all other words given the category of the document. Even\\nthough this assumption does not hold in general { for instance, the word\\n\\\\York\" is much more likely to after the word \\\\New\" { it su\\x0eces for our\\npurposes (see Figure 1.16).\\nThis assumption reduces the di\\x0eculty of knowing p(xjy) to that of esti-\\nmating the probabilities of occurrence of individual words w. Estimates for1.3 Basic Algorithms 23\\nyword 1word 2...word nword 3\\nFig. 1.16. Naive Bayes model. The occurrence of individual words is independent\\nof each other, given the category of the text. For instance, the word Viagra is fairly\\nfrequent if y= spam but it is considerably less frequent if y= ham, except when\\nconsidering the mailbox of a P\\x0czer sales representative.\\np(wjy) can be obtained, for instance, by simply counting the frequency oc-\\ncurrence of the word within documents of a given class. That is, we estimate\\np(wjspam)\\x19Pm\\ni=1P# of words in xi\\nj=1n\\nyi= spam and wj\\ni=wo\\nPm\\ni=1P# of words in xi\\nj=1fyi= spamg\\nHeren\\nyi= spam and wj\\ni=wo\\nequals 1 if and only if xiis labeled as spam\\nandwoccurs as the j-th word in xi. The denominator is simply the total\\nnumber of words in spam documents. Similarly one can compute p(wjham).\\nIn principle we could perform the above summation whenever we see a new\\ndocumentx. This would be terribly ine\\x0ecient, since each such computation\\nrequires a full pass through XandY. Instead, we can perform a single pass\\nthrough XandYand store the resulting statistics as a good estimate of the\\nconditional probabilities. Algorithm 1.1 has details of an implementation.\\nNote that we performed a number of optimizations: Firstly, the normaliza-\\ntion bym\\x001\\nspam andm\\x001\\nhamrespectively is independent of x, hence we incor-\\nporate it as a \\x0cxed o\\x0bset. Secondly, since we are computing a product over\\na large number of factors the numbers might lead to numerical over\\row or\\nunder\\row. This can be addressed by summing over the logarithm of terms\\nrather than computing products. Thirdly, we need to address the issue of\\nestimating p(wjy) for words wwhich we might not have seen before. One\\nway of dealing with this is to increment all counts by 1. This method is\\ncommonly referred to as Laplace smoothing. We will encounter a theoretical\\njusti\\x0ccation for this heuristic in Section 2.3.\\nThis simple algorithm is known to perform surprisingly well, and variants\\nof it can be found in most modern spam \\x0clters. It amounts to what is\\ncommonly known as \\\\Bayesian spam \\x0cltering\". Obviously, we may apply it\\nto problems other than document categorization, too.24 1 Introduction\\nAlgorithm 1.1 Naive Bayes\\nTrain( X;Y)freads documents Xand labels Yg\\nCompute dictionary DofXwithnwords.\\nComputem;m hamandmspam.\\nInitializeb:= logc+logmham\\x00logmspam to o\\x0bset the rejection threshold\\nInitializep2R2\\x02nwithpij= 1,wspam =n,wham=n.\\nfCount occurrence of each word g\\nfHerexj\\nidenotes the number of times word joccurs in document xig\\nfori= 1 tomdo\\nifyi= spam then\\nforj= 1 tondo\\np0;j p0;j+xj\\ni\\nwspam wspam+xj\\ni\\nend for\\nelse\\nforj= 1 tondo\\np1;j p1;j+xj\\ni\\nwham wham+xj\\ni\\nend for\\nend if\\nend for\\nfNormalize counts to yield word probabilities g\\nforj= 1 tondo\\np0;j p0;j=wspam\\np1;j p1;j=wham\\nend for\\nClassify(x)fclassi\\x0ces document xg\\nInitialize score threshold t=\\x00b\\nforj= 1 tondo\\nt t+xj(logp0;j\\x00logp1;j)\\nend for\\nift>0return spam else return ham\\n1.3.2 Nearest Neighbor Estimators\\nAn even simpler estimator than Naive Bayes is nearest neighbors. In its most\\nbasic form it assigns the label of its nearest neighbor to an observation x\\n(see Figure 1.17). Hence, all we need to implement it is a distance measure\\nd(x;x0) between pairs of observations. Note that this distance need not even\\nbe symmetric. This means that nearest neighbor classi\\x0cers can be extremely1.3 Basic Algorithms 25\\nFig. 1.17. 1 nearest neighbor classi\\x0cer. Depending on whether the query point xis\\nclosest to the star, diamond or triangles, it uses one of the three labels for it.\\nFig. 1.18.k-Nearest neighbor classi\\x0cers using Euclidean distances.

Right: decision\\nboundary determining where the blue or red dots are in the majority.\\n\\rexible. For instance, we could use string edit distances to compare two\\ndocuments or information theory based measures.\\nHowever, the problem with nearest neighbor classi\\x0ccation is that the esti-\\nmates can be very noisy whenever the data itself is very noisy. For instance,\\nif a spam email is erroneously labeled as nonspam then all emails which\\nare similar to this email will share the same fate. See Figure 1.18 for an\\nexample. In this case it is bene\\x0ccial to pool together a number of neighbors,\\nsay thek-nearest neighbors of xand use a majority vote to decide the class\\nmembership of x. Algorithm 1.2 has a description of the algorithm. Note\\nthat nearest neighbor algorithms can yield excellent performance when used\\nwith a good distance measure. For instance, the technology underlying the\\nNet\\rix progress prize [BK07] was essentially nearest neighbours based.\\nNote that it is trivial to extend the algorithm to regression. All we need\\nto change in Algorithm 1.2 is to return the average of the values yiinstead\\nof their majority vote. Figure 1.19 has an example.\\nNote that the distance computation d(xi;x) for all observations can be-26 1 Introduction\\nAlgorithm 1.2 k-Nearest Neighbor Classi\\x0ccation\\nClassify( X;Y;x)freads documents X, labels Yand queryxg\\nfori= 1tomdo\\nCompute distance d(xi;x)\\nend for\\nCompute set Icontaining indices for the ksmallest distances d(xi;x).\\nreturn majority label of fyiwherei2Ig.\\nFig. 1.19.k-Nearest neighbor regression estimator using Euclidean distances.

Note that the regression estimate is\\nmuch more smooth.\\ncome extremely costly, in particular whenever the number of observations is\\nlarge or whenever the observations xilive in a very high dimensional space.\\nRandom projections are a technique that can alleviate the high computa-\\ntional cost of Nearest Neighbor classi\\x0cers. A celebrated lemma by Johnson\\nand Lindenstrauss [DG03] asserts that a set of mpoints in high dimensional\\nEuclidean space can be projected into a O(logm=\\x0f2) dimensional Euclidean\\nspace such that the distance between any two points changes only by a fac-\\ntor of (1\\x06\\x0f). Since Euclidean distances are preserved, running the Nearest\\nNeighbor classi\\x0cer on this mapped data yields the same results but at a\\nlower computational cost [GIM99].\\nThe surprising fact is that the projection relies on a simple randomized\\nalgorithm: to obtain a d-dimensional representation of n-dimensional ran-\\ndom observations we pick a matrix R2Rd\\x02nwhere each element is drawn\\nindependently from a normal distribution with n\\x001\\n2variance and zero mean.\\nMultiplying xwith this projection matrix can be shown to achieve this prop-\\nerty with high probability.

An even simpler approach than using the\\nnearest neighbor classi\\x0cer would be to use the class label which corresponds\\nto the mean closest to a new query x, as described in Figure 1.20.\\nFor Euclidean distances we have\\nk\\x16\\x00\\x00xk2=k\\x16\\x00k2+kxk2\\x002h\\x16\\x00;xiand (1.19)\\nk\\x16+\\x00xk2=k\\x16+k2+kxk2\\x002h\\x16+;xi: (1.20)\\nHereh\\x01;\\x01idenotes the standard dot product between vectors.

Recall that when dealing\\nwith documents we needed to perform pre-processing to map e-mails into a\\nvector space. In general, we may pick arbitrary maps \\x1e:X!Hmapping\\nthe space of observations into a feature space H, as long as the latter is\\nendowed with a dot product (see Figure 1.21). This means that instead of\\ndealing withhx;x0iwe will be dealing with h\\x1e(x);\\x1e(x0)i.\\nAs we will see in Chapter 6, whenever His a so-called Reproducing Kernel\\nHilbert Space, the inner product can be abbreviated in the form of a kernel\\nfunctionk(x;x0) which satis\\x0ces\\nk(x;x0) :=\\n\\x1e(x);\\x1e(x0)\\x0b\\n: (1.23)\\nThis small modi\\x0ccation leads to a number of very powerful algorithm and\\nit is at the foundation of an area of research called kernel methods.

In real life, such a set might be di\\x0ecult\\nto obtain all at once. Instead, a user might want to have instant results when-\\never a new e-mail arrives and he would like the system to learn immediately\\nfrom any corrections to mistakes the system makes.\\nTo overcome both these di\\x0eculties one could envisage working with the\\nfollowing protocol: As emails arrive our algorithm classi\\x0ces them as spam or\\nnon-spam, and the user provides feedback as to whether the classi\\x0ccation is\\ncorrect or incorrect. This feedback is then used to improve the performance\\nof the classi\\x0cer over a period of time.\\nThis intuition can be formalized as follows: Our classi\\x0cer maintains a\\nparameter vector. At the t-th time instance it receives a data point xt, to\\nwhich it assigns a label ^ ytusing its current parameter vector. The true label\\nytis then revealed, and used to update the parameter vector of the classi\\x0cer.\\nSuch algorithms are said to be online . We will now describe perhaps the\\nsimplest classi\\x0cer of this kind namely the Perceptron [Heb49, Ros58].\\nLet us assume that the data points xt2Rd, and labels yt2f\\x06 1g. As\\nbefore we represent an email as a bag-of-words vector and we assign +1 to\\nspam emails and\\x001 to non-spam emails.

On the other hand, if ^ yt6=ytthe weight vector is\\nupdated as\\nw w+ytxtandb b+yt: (1.26)\\nFigure 1.22 shows an update step of the Perceptron algorithm. For simplicity\\nwe illustrate the case without bias, that is, where b= 0 and where it remains\\nunchanged. A detailed description of the algorithm is given in Algorithm 1.3.\\nAn important property of the algorithm is that it performs updates on w\\nby multiples of the observations xion which it makes a mistake. Hence we\\nmay express wasw=P\\ni2Erroryixi. Just as before, we can replace xiandx\\nby\\x1e(xi) and\\x1e(x) to obtain a kernelized version of the Perceptron algorithm\\n[FS99] (Algorithm 1.4).\\nIf the dataset ( X;Y) is linearly separable, then the Perceptron algorithm1.3 Basic Algorithms 31\\neventually converges and correctly classi\\x0ces all the points in X. The rate of\\nconvergence however depends on the margin. Roughly speaking, the margin\\nquanti\\x0ces how linearly separable a dataset is, and hence how easy it is to\\nsolve a given classi\\x0ccation problem.\\nDe\\x0cnition 1.6 (Margin) Letw2Rdbe a weight vector and let b2Rbe\\nan o\\x0bset.

Larger the margin,\\nthe more well separated the data and hence easier it is to \\x0cnd a hyperplane\\nwith correctly classi\\x0ces the dataset. The following theorem asserts that if\\nthere exists a linear classi\\x0cer which can classify a dataset with a large mar-\\ngin, then the Perceptron will also correctly classify the same dataset after\\nmaking a small number of mistakes.\\nTheorem 1.7 (Noviko\\x0b\\'s theorem) Let(X;Y)be a dataset with at least\\none example labeled +1and one example labeled \\x001.

Then, the Perceptron will make at most(1+R2)(1+(b\\x03)2)\\n\\r2\\nmistakes.\\nThis result is remarkable since it does notdepend on the dimensionality\\nof the problem. Instead, it only depends on the geometry of the setting,\\nas quanti\\x0ced via the margin \\rand the radius Rof a ball enclosing the\\nobservations. Interestingly, a similar bound can be shown for Support Vector\\nMachines [Vap95] which we will be discussing in Chapter 7.\\nProof We can safely ignore the iterations where no mistakes were made\\nand hence no updates were carried out. Therefore, without loss of generality\\nassume that the t-th update was made after seeing the t-th observation and\\nletwtdenote the weight vector after the update.

The key insight was to combine large numbers of such net-\\nworks, often in a cascading fashion, to larger objects and to fashion opti-\\nmization algorithms which would lead to classi\\x0cers with desirable properties.\\nIn this book we will take a complementary route. Instead of increasing the\\nnumber of nodes we will investigate what happens when increasing the com-\\nplexity of the feature map \\x1eand its associated kernel k. The advantage of\\ndoing so is that we will reap the bene\\x0cts from convex analysis and linear\\nmodels, possibly at the expense of a slightly more costly function evaluation.\\n1.3.5 K-Means\\nAll the algorithms we discussed so far are supervised, that is, they assume\\nthat labeled training data is available. In many applications this is too much\\nto hope for; labeling may be expensive, error prone, or sometimes impossi-\\nble. For instance, it is very easy to crawl and collect every page within the\\nwww.purdue.edu domain, but rather time consuming to assign a topic to\\neach page based on its contents. In such cases, one has to resort to unsuper-\\nvised learning. A prototypical unsupervised learning algorithm is K-means,\\nwhich is clustering algorithm. Given X=fx1;:::;xmgthe goal of K-means\\nis to partition it into kclusters such that each point in a cluster is similar\\nto points from its own cluster than with points from some other cluster.1.3 Basic Algorithms 33\\nTowards this end, de\\x0cne prototype vectors \\x161;:::;\\x16kand an indicator\\nvectorrijwhich is 1 if, and only if, xiis assigned to cluster j. To cluster our\\ndataset we will minimize the following distortion measure, which minimizes\\nthe distance of each point from the prototype vector:\\nJ(r;\\x16) :=1\\n2mX\\ni=1kX\\nj=1rijkxi\\x00\\x16jk2; (1.29)\\nwherer=frijg,\\x16=f\\x16jg, andk\\x01k2denotes the usual Euclidean square\\nnorm.\\nOur goal is to \\x0cnd rand\\x16, but since it is not easy to jointly minimize J\\nwith respect to both rand\\x16, we will adapt a two stage strategy:\\nStage 1 Keep the\\x16\\x0cxed and determine r. In this case, it is easy to see\\nthat the minimization decomposes into mindependent problems.\\nThe solution for the i-th data point xican be found by setting:\\nrij= 1 ifj= argmin\\nj0kxi\\x00\\x16j0k2; (1.30)\\nand 0 otherwise.\\nStage 2 Keep ther\\x0cxed and determine \\x16. Since the r\\'s are \\x0cxed, Jis an\\nquadratic function of \\x16. It can be minimized by setting the derivative\\nwith respect to \\x16jto be 0:\\nmX\\ni=1rij(xi\\x00\\x16j) = 0 for all j: (1.31)\\nRearranging obtains\\n\\x16j=P\\nirijxiP\\nirij: (1.32)\\nSinceP\\nirijcounts the number of points assigned to cluster j, we are\\nessentially setting \\x16jto be the sample mean of the points assigned\\nto clusterj.\\nThe algorithm stops when the cluster assignments do not change signi\\x0c-\\ncantly. Detailed pseudo-code can be found in Algorithm 1.5.\\nTwo issues with K-Means are worth noting. First, it is sensitive to the\\nchoice of the initial cluster centers \\x16. A number of practical heuristics have\\nbeen developed. For instance, one could randomly choose kpoints from the\\ngiven dataset as cluster centers. Other methods try to pick kpoints from X\\nwhich are farthest away from each other. Second, it makes a hard assignment\\nof every point to a cluster center. Variants which we will encounter later in34 1 Introduction\\nAlgorithm 1.5 K-Means\\nCluster( X)fCluster dataset Xg\\nInitialize cluster centers \\x16jforj= 1;:::;k randomly\\nrepeat\\nfori= 1tomdo\\nComputej0= argminj=1;:::;kd(xi;\\x16j)\\nSetrij0= 1 andrij= 0 for allj06=j\\nend for\\nforj= 1tokdo\\nCompute\\x16j=P\\nirijxiP\\nirij\\nend for\\nuntil Cluster assignments rijare unchanged\\nreturnf\\x161;:::;\\x16kgandrij\\nthe book will relax this.

They provide a useful\\nstarting point for an aspiring machine learning researcher. In this book we\\nwill see many more such algorithms as well as connections between these\\nbasic algorithms and their more advanced counterparts.\\nProblems\\nProblem 1.1 (Eyewitness) Assume that an eyewitness is 90% certain\\nthat a given person committed a crime in a bar.

As\\nit happens, it is your unlucky day and among the 100 times you toss the\\ndice, you only see \\'6\\' eleven times. For a fair dice we know that each face\\nshould occur with equal probability1\\n6. Hence the expected value over 100\\ndraws is100\\n6\\x1917, which is considerably more than the eleven times that we\\nobserved. Before crying foul you decide that some mathematical analysis is\\nin order.\\nThe probability of seeing a particular sequence of mtrials out of which n\\nare a \\'6\\' is given by1\\n6n5\\n6m\\x00n. Moreover, there are\\x00m\\nn\\x01\\n=m!\\nn!(m\\x00n)!di\\x0berent\\nsequences of \\'6\\' and \\'not 6\\' with proportions nandm\\x00nrespectively.

The second and third term are the probabilities\\nof seeing one particular instance of such a sequence.\\nNote that in general we may not be as lucky, since we may have con-\\nsiderably less information about the setting we are studying. For instance,\\nwe might not know the actual probabilities for each face of the dice, which\\nwould be a likely assumption when gambling at a casino of questionable\\nreputation. Often the outcomes of the system we are dealing with may be\\ncontinuous valued random variables rather than binary ones, possibly even\\nwith unknown range. For instance, when trying to determine the average\\nwage through a questionnaire we need to determine how many people we\\nneed to ask in order to obtain a certain level of con\\x0cdence.\\nTo answer such questions we need to discuss limit theorems. They tell\\nus by how much averages over a set of observations may deviate from the\\ncorresponding expectations and how many observations we need to draw to\\nestimate a number of probabilities reliably. For completeness we will present\\nproofs for some of the more fundamental theorems in Section 2.1.2. They\\nare useful albeit non-essential for the understanding of the remainder of the\\nbook and may be omitted.\\n2.1.1 Fundamental Laws\\nThe Law of Large Numbers developed by Bernoulli in 1713 is one of the\\nfundamental building blocks of statistical analysis. It states that averages\\nover a number of observations converge to their expectations given a su\\x0e-\\nciently large number of observations and given certain assumptions on the\\nindependence of these observations. It comes in two \\ravors: the weak and\\nthe strong law.\\nTheorem 2.1 (Weak Law of Large Numbers) Denote by X1;:::;Xm\\nrandom variables drawn from p(x)with mean\\x16=EXi[xi]for alli. Moreover\\nlet\\n\\x16Xm:=1\\nmmX\\ni=1Xi (2.2)\\nbe the empirical average over the random variables Xi. Then for any \\x0f>0\\nthe following holds\\nlim\\nm!1Pr\\x00\\x0c\\x0c\\x16Xm\\x00\\x16\\x0c\\x0c\\x14\\x0f\\x01\\n= 1: (2.3)2.1 Limit Theorems 39\\n101102103123456\\nFig. 2.2. The mean of a number of casts of a dice. The horizontal straight line\\ndenotes the mean 3.5. The uneven solid line denotes the actual mean \\x16Xnas a\\nfunction of the number of draws, given as a semilogarithmic plot. The crosses denote\\nthe outcomes of the dice. Note how \\x16Xnever more closely approaches the mean 3 :5\\nare we obtain an increasing number of observations.\\nThis establishes that, indeed, for large enough sample sizes, the average will\\nconverge to the expectation. The strong law strengthens this as follows:\\nTheorem 2.2 (Strong Law of Large Numbers) Under the conditions\\nof Theorem 2.1 we have Pr\\x00\\nlimm!1\\x16Xm=\\x16\\x01\\n= 1.\\nThe strong law implies that almost surely (in a measure theoretic sense) \\x16Xm\\nconverges to \\x16, whereas the weak law only states that for every \\x0fthe random\\nvariable \\x16Xmwill be within the interval [ \\x16\\x00\\x0f;\\x16+\\x0f]. Clearly the strong implies\\nthe weak law since the measure of the events \\x16Xm=\\x16converges to 1, hence\\nany\\x0f-ball around \\x16would capture this.\\nBoth laws justify that we may take sample averages, e.g. over a number\\nof events such as the outcomes of a dice and use the latter to estimate their\\nmeans, their probabilities (here we treat the indicator variable of the event\\nas af0; 1g-valued random variable), their variances or related quantities. We\\npostpone a proof until Section 2.1.2, since an e\\x0bective way of proving Theo-\\nrem 2.1 relies on the theory of characteristic functions which we will discuss\\nin the next section. For the moment, we only give a pictorial illustration in\\nFigure 2.2.\\nOnce we established that the random variable \\x16Xm=m\\x001Pm\\ni=1Xicon-\\nverges to its mean \\x16, a natural second question is to establish how quickly it\\nconverges and what the properties of the limiting distribution of \\x16Xm\\x00\\x16are.\\nNote in Figure 2.2 that the initial deviation from the mean is large whereas\\nas we observe more data the empirical mean approaches the true one.40 2 Density Estimation\\n101102103123456\\nFig. 2.3. Five instantiations of a running average over outcomes of a toss of a dice.\\nNote that all of them converge to the mean 3 :5. Moreover note that they all are\\nwell contained within the upper and lower envelopes given by \\x16\\x06p\\nVarX[x]=m.\\nThe central limit theorem answers this question exactly by addressing a\\nslightly more general question, namely whether the sum over a number of\\nindependent random variables where each of them arises from a di\\x0berent\\ndistribution might also have a well behaved limiting distribution. This is\\nthe case as long as the variance of each of the random variables is bounded.\\nThe limiting distribution of such a sum is Gaussian. This a\\x0erms the pivotal\\nrole of the Gaussian distribution.\\nTheorem 2.3 (Central Limit Theorem) Denote byXiindependent ran-\\ndom variables with means \\x16iand standard deviation \\x1bi. Then\\nZm:=\"mX\\ni=1\\x1b2\\ni#\\x001\\n2\"mX\\ni=1Xi\\x00\\x16i#\\n(2.4)\\nconverges to a Normal Distribution with zero mean and unit variance.\\nNote that just like the law of large numbers the central limit theorem (CLT)\\nis an asymptotic result. That is, only in the limit of an in\\x0cnite number of\\nobservations will it become exact. That said, it often provides an excellent\\napproximation even for \\x0cnite numbers of observations, as illustrated in Fig-\\nure 2.4. In fact, the central limit theorem and related limit theorems build\\nthe foundation of what is known as asymptotic statistics.\\nExample 2.1 (Dice) If we are interested in computing the mean of the\\nvalues returned by a dice we may apply the CLT to the sum over mvariables2.1 Limit Theorems 41\\nwhich have all mean \\x16= 3:5and variance (see Problem 2.1)\\nVarX[x] =EX[x2]\\x00EX[x]2= (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36) =6\\x003:52\\x192:92:\\nWe now study the random variable Wm:=m\\x001Pm\\ni=1[Xi\\x003:5]. Since each\\nof the terms in the sum has zero mean, also Wm\\'s mean vanishes. Moreover,\\nWmis a multiple of Zmof (2.4). Hence we have that Wmconverges to a\\nnormal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation 2:92m\\x001\\n2.\\nConsequently the average of mtosses of the dice yields a random vari-\\nable with mean 3:5and it will approach a normal distribution with variance\\nm\\x001\\n22:92. In other words, the empirical mean converges to its average at\\nrateO(m\\x001\\n2). Figure 2.3 gives an illustration of the quality of the bounds\\nimplied by the CLT.\\nOne remarkable property of functions of random variables is that in many\\nconditions convergence properties of the random variables are bestowed upon\\nthe functions, too. This is manifest in the following two results: a variant\\nof Slutsky\\'s theorem and the so-called delta method. The former deals with\\nlimit behavior whereas the latter deals with an extension of the central limit\\ntheorem.\\nTheorem 2.4 (Slutsky\\'s Theorem) Denote byXi;Yisequences of ran-\\ndom variables with Xi!XandYi!cforc2Rin probability. Moreover,\\ndenote byg(x;y)a function which is continuous for all (x;c). In this case\\nthe random variable g(Xi;Yi)converges in probability to g(X;c).\\nFor a proof see e.g. [Bil68]. Theorem 2.4 is often referred to as the continuous\\nmapping theorem (Slutsky only proved the result for a\\x0ene functions). It\\nmeans that for functions of random variables it is possible to pull the limiting\\nprocedure into the function. Such a device is useful when trying to prove\\nasymptotic normality and in order to obtain characterizations of the limiting\\ndistribution.\\nTheorem 2.5 (Delta Method) Assume that Xn2Rdis asymptotically\\nnormal with a\\x002\\nn(Xn\\x00b)!N(0;\\x06)fora2\\nn!0. Moreover, assume that\\ng:Rd!Rlis a mapping which is continuously di\\x0berentiable at b. In this\\ncase the random variable g(Xn)converges\\na\\x002\\nn(g(Xn)\\x00g(b))!N(0;[rxg(b)]\\x06[rxg(b)]>): (2.5)\\nProof Via a Taylor expansion we see that\\na\\x002\\nn[g(Xn)\\x00g(b)] = [rxg(\\x18n)]>a\\x002\\nn(Xn\\x00b) (2.6)42 2 Density Estimation\\nHere\\x18nlies on the line segment [ b;Xn]. SinceXn!bwe have that \\x18n!b,\\ntoo. Sincegis continuously di\\x0berentiable at bwe may apply Slutsky\\'s the-\\norem to see that a\\x002\\nn[g(Xn)\\x00g(b)]![rxg(b)]>a\\x002\\nn(Xn\\x00b). As a con-\\nsequence, the transformed random variable is asymptotically normal with\\ncovariance [rxg(b)]\\x06[rxg(b)]>.\\nWe will use the delta method when it comes to investigating properties of\\nmaximum likelihood estimators in exponential families. There gwill play the\\nrole of a mapping between expectations and the natural parametrization of\\na distribution.\\n2.1.2 The Characteristic Function\\nThe Fourier transform plays a crucial role in many areas of mathematical\\nanalysis and engineering. This is equally true in statistics. For historic rea-\\nsons its applications to distributions is called the characteristic function,\\nwhich we will discuss in this section. At its foundations lie standard tools\\nfrom functional analysis and signal processing [Rud73, Pap62]. We begin by\\nrecalling the basic properties:\\nDe\\x0cnition 2.6 (Fourier Transform) Denote byf:Rn!Ca function\\nde\\x0cned on a d-dimensional Euclidean space. Moreover, let x;!2Rn. Then\\nthe Fourier transform Fand its inverse F\\x001are given by\\nF[f](!) := (2\\x19)\\x00d\\n2Z\\nRnf(x) exp(\\x00ih!;xi)dx (2.7)\\nF\\x001[g](x) := (2\\x19)\\x00d\\n2Z\\nRng(!) exp(ih!;xi)d!: (2.8)\\nThe key insight is that F\\x001\\x0eF=F\\x0eF\\x001= Id. In other words, Fand\\nF\\x001are inverses to each other for all functions which are L2integrable on\\nRd, which includes probability distributions. One of the key advantages of\\nFourier transforms is that derivatives and convolutions on ftranslate into\\nmultiplications. That is F[f\\x0eg] = (2\\x19)d\\n2F[f]\\x01F[g]. The same rule applies\\nto the inverse transform, i.e. F\\x001[f\\x0eg] = (2\\x19)d\\n2F\\x001[f]F\\x001[g].\\nThe bene\\x0ct for statistical analysis is that often problems are more easily\\nexpressed in the Fourier domain and it is easier to prove convergence results\\nthere. These results then carry over to the original domain. We will be\\nexploiting this fact in the proof of the law of large numbers and the central\\nlimit theorem. Note that the de\\x0cnition of Fourier transforms can be extended\\nto more general domains such as groups. See e.g. [BCR84] for further details.2.1 Limit Theorems 43\\nWe next introduce the notion of a characteristic function of a distribution.1\\nDe\\x0cnition 2.7 (Characteristic Function) Denote byp(x)a distribution\\nof a random variable X2Rd. Then the characteristic function \\x1eX(!)with\\n!2Rdis given by\\n\\x1eX(!) := (2\\x19)d\\n2F\\x001[p(x)] =Z\\nexp(ih!;xi)dp(x): (2.9)\\nIn other words, \\x1eX(!) is the inverse Fourier transform applied to the prob-\\nability measure p(x). Consequently \\x1eX(!)uniquely characterizes p(x) and\\nmoreover,p(x) can be recovered from \\x1eX(!) via the forward Fourier trans-\\nform. One of the key utilities of characteristic functions is that they allow\\nus to deal in easy ways with sums of random variables.\\nTheorem 2.8 (Sums of random variables and convolutions) Denote\\nbyX;Y2Rtwo independent random variables. Moreover, denote by Z:=\\nX+Ythe sum of both random variables. Then the distribution over Zsat-\\nis\\x0cesp(z) =p(x)\\x0ep(y). Moreover, the characteristic function yields:\\n\\x1eZ(!) =\\x1eX(!)\\x1eY(!): (2.10)\\nProofZis given by Z=X+Y. Hence, for a given Z=zwe have\\nthe freedom to choose X=xfreely provided that Y=z\\x00x. In terms of\\ndistributions this means that the joint distribution p(z;x) is given by\\np(z;x) =p(Y=z\\x00x)p(x)\\nand hencep(z) =Z\\np(Y=z\\x00x)dp(x) = [p(x)\\x0ep(y)](z):\\nThe result for characteristic functions follows form the property of the\\nFourier transform.\\nFor sums of several random variables the characteristic function is the prod-\\nuct of the individual characteristic functions. This allows us to prove both\\nthe weak law of large numbers and the central limit theorem (see Figure 2.4\\nfor an illustration) by proving convergence in the Fourier domain.\\nProof [Weak Law of Large Numbers] At the heart of our analysis lies\\na Taylor expansion of the exponential into\\nexp(iwx) = 1 +ihw;xi+o(jwj)\\nand hence\\x1eX(!) = 1 +iwEX[x] +o(jwj):\\n1In Chapter ??we will discuss more general descriptions of distributions of which \\x1eXis a special\\ncase. In particular, we will replace the exponential exp( ih!;xi) by a kernel function k(x;x0).44 2 Density Estimation\\n-5050.00.51.0\\n-5050.00.51.0\\n-5050.00.51.0\\n-5050.00.51.0\\n-5050.00.51.0\\n-1010.00.51.01.5\\n-1010.00.51.01.5\\n-1010.00.51.01.5\\n-1010.00.51.01.5\\n-1010.00.51.01.5\\nFig. 2.4.

Our proof relies on showing convergence\\nof the characteristic function of Zm, i.e.\\x1eZmto that of a normally dis-\\ntributed random variable Wwith zero mean and unit variance.

We have\\nthat limm!1\\x1eZm(!) = exp(\\x001\\n2!2) which is the characteristic function of\\nthe normal distribution with zero mean and variance 1. Since the character-\\nistic function transform is injective this proves our claim.\\nNote that the characteristic function has a number of useful properties. For\\ninstance, it can also be used as moment generating function via the identity:\\nrn\\n!\\x1eX(0) =i\\x00nEX[xn]: (2.12)\\nIts proof is left as an exercise. See Problem 2.2 for details. This connection\\nalso implies (subject to regularity conditions) that if we know the moments\\nof a distribution we are able to reconstruct it directly since it allows us\\nto reconstruct its characteristic function. This idea has been exploited in\\ndensity estimation [Cra46] in the form of Edgeworth and Gram-Charlier\\nexpansions [Hal92].\\n2.1.3 Tail Bounds\\nIn practice we never have access to an in\\x0cnite number of observations. Hence\\nthe central limit theorem does not apply but is just an approximation to the\\nreal situation. For instance, in the case of the dice, we might want to state\\nworst case bounds for\\x0cnite sums of random variables to determine by how\\nmuch the empirical mean may deviate from its expectation. Those bounds\\nwill not only be useful for simple averages but to quantify the behavior of\\nmore sophisticated estimators based on a set of observations.\\nThe bounds we discuss below di\\x0ber in the amount of knowledge they\\nassume about the random variables in question. For instance, we might only46 2 Density Estimation\\nknow their mean. This leads to the Gauss-Markov inequality. If we know\\ntheir mean and their variance we are able to state a stronger bound, the\\nChebyshev inequality. For an even stronger setting, when we know that\\neach variable has bounded range, we will be able to state a Cherno\\x0b bound.\\nThose bounds are progressively more tight and also more di\\x0ecult to prove.\\nWe state them in order of technical sophistication.\\nTheorem 2.9 (Gauss-Markov) Denote byX\\x150a random variable and\\nlet\\x16be its mean. Then for any \\x0f>0we have\\nPr(X\\x15\\x0f)\\x14\\x16\\n\\x0f: (2.13)\\nProof We use the fact that for nonnegative random variables\\nPr(X\\x15\\x0f) =Z1\\n\\x0fdp(x)\\x14Z1\\n\\x0fx\\n\\x0fdp(x)\\x14\\x0f\\x001Z1\\n0xdp(x) =\\x16\\n\\x0f:\\nThis means that for random variables with a small mean, the proportion of\\nsamples with large value has to be small.\\nConsequently deviations from the mean are O(\\x0f\\x001). However, note that this\\nbound does notdepend on the number of observations. A useful application\\nof the Gauss-Markov inequality is Chebyshev\\'s inequality. It is a statement\\non the range of random variables using its variance.\\nTheorem 2.10 (Chebyshev) Denote byXa random variable with mean\\n\\x16and variance \\x1b2. Then the following holds for \\x0f>0:\\nPr(jx\\x00\\x16j\\x15\\x0f)\\x14\\x1b2\\n\\x0f2: (2.14)\\nProof Denote by Y:=jX\\x00\\x16j2the random variable quantifying the\\ndeviation of Xfrom its mean \\x16.

Applying Theorem 2.9 to Yand\\ryields Pr(Y >\\r )\\x14\\x1b2=\\r\\nwhich proves the claim.\\nNote the improvement to the Gauss-Markov inequality. Where before we had\\nbounds whose con\\x0cdence improved with O(\\x0f\\x001) we can now state O(\\x0f\\x002)\\nbounds for deviations from the mean.\\nExample 2.2 (Chebyshev bound) Assume that \\x16Xm:=m\\x001Pm\\ni=1Xiis\\nthe average over mrandom variables with mean \\x16and variance \\x1b2.

Using the latter, we reap an exponential improve-\\nment in the quality of the bounds in the form of the McDiarmid [McD89]\\ninequality. We state the latter without proof:\\nTheorem 2.11 (McDiarmid) Denote by f:Xm!Ra function on X\\nand letXibe independent random variables. In this case the following holds:\\nPr (jf(x1;:::;xm)\\x00EX1;:::;Xm[f(x1;:::;xm)]j>\\x0f)\\x142 exp\\x00\\n\\x002\\x0f2C\\x002\\x01\\n:\\nHere the constant C2is given by C2=Pm\\ni=1c2\\niwhere\\n\\x0c\\x0cf(x1;:::;xi;:::;xm)\\x00f(x1;:::;x0\\ni;:::;xm)\\x0c\\x0c\\x14ci\\nfor allx1;:::;xm;x0\\niand for all i.\\nThis bound can be used for averages of a number of observations when\\nthey are computed according to some algorithm as long as the latter can be\\nencoded in f. In particular, we have the following bound [Hoe63]:\\nTheorem 2.12 (Hoe\\x0bding) Denote byXiiid random variables with bounded\\nrangeXi2[a;b]and mean\\x16. Let \\x16Xm:=m\\x001Pm\\ni=1Xibe their average.\\nThen the following bound holds:\\nPr\\x00\\x0c\\x0c\\x16Xm\\x00\\x16\\x0c\\x0c>\\x0f\\x01\\n\\x142 exp\\x12\\n\\x002m\\x0f2\\n(b\\x00a)2\\x13\\n: (2.15)\\nProof This is a corollary of Theorem 2.11.

Plugging this back into\\nMcDiarmid\\'s theorem proves the claim.\\nNote that (2.15) is exponentially better than the previous bounds. With\\nincreasing sample size the con\\x0cdence level also increases exponentially.\\nExample 2.3 (Hoe\\x0bding bound) As in example 2.2 assume that Xiare\\niid random variables and let \\x16Xmbe their average. Moreover, assume that48 2 Density Estimation\\nXi2[a;b]for alli. As before we want to obtain guarantees on the probability\\nthatj\\x16Xm\\x00\\x16j>\\x0f.

Straightforward algebra shows that in this case \\x0fneeds to satisfy\\n\\x0f\\x15jb\\x00ajp\\n[log 2\\x00log\\x0e]=2m (2.17)\\nIn other words, while the con\\x0cdence level only enters logarithmically into the\\ninequality, the sample size mimproves our con\\x0cdence only with \\x0f=O(m\\x001\\n2).\\nThat is, in order to improve our con\\x0cdence interval from \\x0f= 0:1to\\x0f= 0:01\\nwe need 100 times as many observations.\\nWhile this bound is tight (see Problem 2.5 for details), it is possible to ob-\\ntain better bounds if we know additional information. In particular knowing\\na bound on the variance of a random variable in addition to knowing that it\\nhas bounded range would allow us to strengthen the statement considerably.\\nThe Bernstein inequality captures this connection. For details see [BBL05]\\nor works on empirical process theory [vdVW96, SW86, Vap82].\\n2.1.4 An Example\\nIt is probably easiest to illustrate the various bounds using a concrete exam-\\nple. In a semiconductor fab processors are produced on a wafer. A typical\\n300mm wafer holds about 400 chips. A large number of processing steps\\nare required to produce a \\x0cnished microprocessor and often it is impossible\\nto assess the e\\x0bect of a design decision until the \\x0cnished product has been\\nproduced.\\nAssume that the production manager wants to change some step from\\nprocess \\'A\\' to some other process \\'B\\'. The goal is to increase the yield of\\nthe process, that is, the number of chips of the 400 potential chips on the\\nwafer which can be sold. Unfortunately this number is a random variable,\\ni.e. the number of working chips per wafer can vary widely between di\\x0berent\\nwafers. Since process \\'A\\' has been running in the factory for a very long\\ntime we may assume that the yield is well known, say it is \\x16A= 350 out\\nof 400 processors on average. It is our goal to determine whether process\\n\\'B\\' is better and what its yield may be. Obviously, since production runs\\nare expensive we want to be able to determine this number as quickly as\\npossible, i.e. using as few wafers as possible. The production manager is risk\\naverse and wants to ensure that the new process is really better. Hence he\\nrequires a con\\x0cdence level of 95% before he will change the production.2.1 Limit Theorems 49\\nA \\x0crst step is to formalize the problem. Since we know process \\'A\\' exactly\\nwe only need to concern ourselves with \\'B\\'. We associate the random variable\\nXiwith wafer i. A reasonable (and somewhat simplifying) assumption is to\\nposit that all Xiare independent and identically distributed where all Xi\\nhave the mean \\x16B. Obviously we do not know \\x16B| otherwise there would\\nbe no reason for testing! We denote by \\x16Xmthe average of the yields of m\\nwafers using process \\'B\\'. What we are interested in is the accuracy \\x0ffor\\nwhich the probability\\n\\x0e= Pr(j\\x16Xm\\x00\\x16Bj>\\x0f) satis\\x0ces\\x0e\\x140:05:\\nLet us now discuss how the various bounds behave. For the sake of the\\nargument assume that \\x16B\\x00\\x16A= 20, i.e. the new process produces on\\naverage 20 additional usable chips.\\nChebyshev In order to apply the Chebyshev inequality we need to bound\\nthe variance of the random variables Xi. The worst possible variance would\\noccur ifXi2f0; 400gwhere both events occur with equal probability. In\\nother words, with equal probability the wafer if fully usable or it is entirely\\nbroken. This amounts to \\x1b2= 0:5(200\\x000)2+ 0:5(200\\x00400)2= 40;000.\\nSince for Chebyshev bounds we have\\n\\x0e\\x14\\x1b2m\\x001\\x0f\\x002(2.18)\\nwe can solve for m=\\x1b2=\\x0e\\x0f2= 40;000=(0:05\\x01400) = 20;000. In other words,\\nwe would typically need 20,000 wafers to assess with reasonable con\\x0cdence\\nwhether process \\'B\\' is better than process \\'A\\'. This is completely unrealistic.\\nSlightly better bounds can be obtained if we are able to make better\\nassumptions on the variance. For instance, if we can be sure that the yield\\nof process \\'B\\' is at least 300, then the largest possible variance is 0 :25(300\\x00\\n0)2+ 0:75(300\\x00400)2= 30;000, leading to a minimum of 15,000 wafers\\nwhich is not much better.\\nHoe\\x0bding Since the yields are in the interval f0;:::; 400gwe have an ex-\\nplicit bound on the range of observations. Recall the inequality (2.16) which\\nbounds the failure probably \\x0e= 0:05 by an exponential term. Solving this\\nformyields\\nm\\x150:5jb\\x00aj2\\x0f\\x002log(2=\\x0e)\\x19737:8 (2.19)\\nIn other words, we need at lest 738 wafers to determine whether process \\'B\\'\\nis better. While this is a signi\\x0ccant improvement of almost two orders of\\nmagnitude, it still seems wasteful and we would like to do better.50 2 Density Estimation\\nCentral Limit Theorem The central limit theorem is an approximation .\\nThis means that our reasoning is not accurate any more. That said, for\\nlarge enough sample sizes, the approximation is good enough to use it for\\npractical predictions. Assume for the moment that we knew the variance \\x1b2\\nexactly. In this case we know that \\x16Xmis approximately normal with mean\\n\\x16Band variance m\\x001\\x1b2. We are interested in the interval [ \\x16\\x00\\x0f;\\x16+\\x0f] which\\ncontains 95% of the probability mass of a normal distribution. That is, we\\nneed to solve the integral\\n1\\n2\\x19\\x1b2Z\\x16+\\x0f\\n\\x16\\x00\\x0fexp\\x12\\n\\x00(x\\x00\\x16)2\\n2\\x1b2\\x13\\ndx= 0:95 (2.20)\\nThis can be solved e\\x0eciently using the cumulative distribution function of\\na normal distribution (see Problem 2.3 for more details). One can check\\nthat (2.20) is solved for \\x0f= 2:96\\x1b. In other words, an interval of \\x062:96\\x1b\\ncontains 95% of the probability mass of a normal distribution. The number\\nof observations is therefore determined by\\n\\x0f= 2:96\\x1b=pmand hencem= 8:76\\x1b2\\n\\x0f2(2.21)\\nAgain, our problem is that we do notknow the variance of the distribution.\\nUsing the worst-case bound on the variance, i.e. \\x1b2= 40;000 would lead to\\na requirement of at least m= 876 wafers for testing. However, while we do\\nnotknow the variance, we may estimate it along with the mean and use the\\nempirical estimate, possibly plus some small constant to ensure we do not\\nunderestimate the variance, instead of the upper bound.\\nAssuming that \\ructuations turn out to be in the order of 50 processors,\\ni.e.\\x1b2= 2500, we are able to reduce our requirement to approximately 55\\nwafers. This is probably an acceptable number for a practical test.\\nRates and Constants The astute reader will have noticed that all three\\ncon\\x0cdence bounds had scaling behavior m=O(\\x0f\\x002). That is, in all cases\\nthe number of observations was a fairly ill behaved function of the amount\\nof con\\x0cdence required. If we were just interested in convergence per se, a\\nstatement like that of the Chebyshev inequality would have been entirely\\nsu\\x0ecient. The various laws and bounds can often be used to obtain con-\\nsiderably better constants for statistical con\\x0cdence guarantees. For more\\ncomplex estimators, such as methods to classify, rank, or annotate data,\\na reasoning such as the one above can become highly nontrivial. See e.g.\\n[MYA94, Vap98] for further details.2.2 Parzen Windows 51\\n2.2 Parzen Windows\\n2.2.1 Discrete Density Estimation\\nThe convergence theorems discussed so far mean that we can use empir-\\nical observations for the purpose of density estimation. Recall the case of\\nthe Naive Bayes classi\\x0cer of Section 1.3.1. One of the key ingredients was\\nthe ability to use information about word counts for di\\x0berent document\\nclasses to estimate the probability p(wjjy), wherewjdenoted the number\\nof occurrences of word jin document x, given that it was labeled y. In the\\nfollowing we discuss an extremely simple and crude method for estimating\\nprobabilities. It relies on the fact that for random variables Xidrawn from\\ndistribution p(x) with discrete values Xi2Xwe have\\nlim\\nm!1^pX(x) =p(x) (2.22)\\nwhere ^pX(x) :=m\\x001mX\\ni=1fxi=xgfor allx2X: (2.23)\\nLet us discuss a concrete case. We assume that we have 12 documents and\\nwould like to estimate the probability of occurrence of the word \\'dog\\' from\\nit. As raw data we have:\\nDocument ID 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\\nOccurrences of `dog\\' 1 0 2 0 4 6 3 0 6 2 0 1\\nThis means that the word `dog\\' occurs the following number of times:\\nOccurrences of `dog\\' 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\\nNumber of documents 4 2 2 1 1 0 2\\nSomething unusual is happening here: for some reason we never observed\\n5 instances of the word dog in our documents, only 4 and less, or alter-\\nnatively 6 times. So what about 5 times? It is reasonable to assume that\\nthe corresponding value should not be 0 either. Maybe we did not sample\\nenough. One possible strategy is to add pseudo-counts to the observations.\\nThis amounts to the following estimate:\\n^pX(x) := (m+jXj)\\x001h\\n1 +mX\\ni=1fxi=xg=p(x)i\\n(2.24)\\nClearly the limit for m!1 is stillp(x). Hence, asymptotically we do not\\nlose anything. This prescription is what we used in Algorithm 1.1 used a\\nmethod called Laplace smoothing. Below we contrast the two methods:52 2 Density Estimation\\nOccurrences of `dog\\' 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\\nNumber of documents 4 2 2 1 1 0 2\\nFrequency of occurrence 0.33 0.17 0.17 0.083 0.083 0 0.17\\nLaplace smoothing 0.26 0.16 0.16 0.11 0.11 0.05 0.16\\nThe problem with this method is that as jXjincreases we need increasingly\\nmore observations to obtain even a modicum of precision. On average, we\\nwill need at least one observation for every x2X. This can be infeasible for\\nlarge domains as the following example shows.\\nExample 2.4 (Curse of Dimensionality) Assume that X=f0;1gd, i.e.\\nxconsists of binary bit vectors of dimensionality d. Asdincreases the size of\\nXincreases exponentially, requiring an exponential number of observations\\nto perform density estimation. For instance, if we work with images, a 100 \\x02\\n100 black and white picture would require in the order of 103010observations\\nto model such fairly low-resolution images accurately. This is clearly utterly\\ninfeasible | the number of particles in the known universe is in the order\\nof1080. Bellman [Bel61] was one of the \\x0crst to formalize this dilemma by\\ncoining the term \\'curse of dimensionality\\'.\\nThis example clearly shows that we need better tools to deal with high-\\ndimensional data. We will present one of such tools in the next section.\\n2.2.2 Smoothing Kernel\\nWe now proceed to proper density estimation. Assume that we want to\\nestimate the distribution of weights of a population. Sample data from a\\npopulation might look as follows: X=f57, 88, 54, 84, 83, 59, 56, 43, 70, 63,\\n90, 98, 102, 97, 106, 99, 103, 112 g. We could use this to perform a density\\nestimate by placing discrete components at the locations xi2Xwith weight\\n1=jXjas what is done in Figure 2.5. There is no reason to believe that weights\\nare quantized in kilograms, or grams, or miligrams (or pounds and stones).\\nAnd even if it were, we would expect that similar weights would have similar\\ndensities associated with it. Indeed, as the right diagram of Figure 2.5 shows,\\nthe corresponding density is continuous.\\nThe key question arising is how we may transform Xinto a realistic\\nestimate of the density p(x). Starting with a \\'density estimate\\' with only\\ndiscrete terms\\n^p(x) =1\\nmmX\\ni=1\\x0e(x\\x00xi) (2.25)2.2 Parzen Windows 53\\nwe may choose to smooth it out by a smoothing kernel h(x) such that the\\nprobability mass becomes somewhat more spread out. For a density estimate\\nonX\\x12Rdthis is achieved by\\n^p(x) =1\\nmmX\\ni=1r\\x00dh\\x00x\\x00xi\\nr\\x01\\n: (2.26)\\nThis expansion is commonly known as the Parzen windows estimate. Note\\nthat obviously hmust be chosen such that h(x)\\x150 for allx2Xand\\nmoreover thatR\\nh(x)dx= 1 in order to ensure that (2.26) is a proper prob-\\nability distribution. We now formally justify this smoothing. Let Rbe a\\nsmall region such that\\nq=Z\\nRp(x)dx:\\nOut of the msamples drawn from p(x), the probability that kof them fall\\nin regionRis given by the binomial distribution\\n\\x12m\\nk\\x13\\nqk(1\\x00q)m\\x00k:\\nThe expected fraction of points falling inside the region can easily be com-\\nputed from the expected value of the Binomial distribution: E[k=m] =q.\\nSimilarly, the variance can be computed as Var[ k=m] =q(1\\x00q)=m. As\\nm!1 the variance goes to 0 and hence the estimate peaks around the\\nexpectation. We can therefore set\\nk\\x19mq:\\nIf we assume that Ris so small that p(x) is constant over R, then\\nq\\x19p(x)\\x01V;\\nwhereVis the volume of R.

By symme-\\ntry, we can interpret this equation as the sum over mcubes centered around\\nmdata points xn. If we replace the cube by any smooth kernel function h(\\x01)\\nthis recovers (2.26).\\nThere exists a large variety of di\\x0berent kernels which can be used for the\\nkernel density estimate. [Sil86] has a detailed description of the properties\\nof a number of kernels. Popular choices are\\nh(x) = (2\\x19)\\x001\\n2e\\x001\\n2x2Gaussian kernel (2.28)\\nh(x) =1\\n2e\\x00jxjLaplace kernel (2.29)\\nh(x) =3\\n4max(0;1\\x00x2) Epanechnikov kernel (2.30)\\nh(x) =1\\n2\\x1f[\\x001;1](x) Uniform kernel (2.31)\\nh(x) = max(0;1\\x00jxj) Triangle kernel : (2.32)\\nFurther kernels are the triweight and the quartic kernel which are basically\\npowers of the Epanechnikov kernel. For practical purposes the Gaussian ker-\\nnel (2.28) or the Epanechnikov kernel (2.30) are most suitable. In particular,\\nthe latter has the attractive property of compact support. This means that\\nfor any given density estimate at location xwe will only need to evaluate\\ntermsh(xi\\x00x) for which the distance kxi\\x00xkis less than r. Such expan-\\nsions are computationally much cheaper, in particular when we make use of\\nfast nearest neighbor search algorithms [GIM99, IM98]. Figure 2.7 has some\\nexamples of kernels.\\n2.2.3 Parameter Estimation\\nSo far we have not discussed the issue of parameter selection. It should be\\nevident from Figure 2.6, though, that it is quite crucial to choose a good\\nkernel width. Clearly, a kernel that is overly wide will oversmooth any \\x0cne\\ndetail that there might be in the density. On the other hand, a very narrow\\nkernel will not be very useful, since it will be able to make statements only\\nabout the locations where we actually observed data.2.2 Parzen Windows 55\\n40\\n 50\\n 60\\n 70\\n 80\\n 90\\n 100 1100.00\\n0.050.10\\n40\\n 50\\n 60\\n 70\\n 80\\n 90\\n 100 1100.00\\n0.01\\n0.02\\n0.03\\n0.040.05\\nFig. 2.5.

From left to right:\\nGaussian kernel, Laplace kernel, Epanechikov kernel, and uniform density.\\nMoreover, there is the issue of choosing a suitable kernel function. The\\nfact that a large variety of them exists might suggest that this is a crucial\\nissue. In practice, this turns out not to be the case and instead, the choice\\nof a suitable kernel width is much more vital for good estimates. In other\\nwords, size matters, shape is secondary.\\nThe problem is that we do not know which kernel width is best for the\\ndata. If the problem is one-dimensional, we might hope to be able to eyeball\\nthe size ofr. Obviously, in higher dimensions this approach fails. A second56 2 Density Estimation\\noption would be to choose rsuch that the log-likelihood of the data is\\nmaximized.

Summing over the logarithm, on the other\\nhand, is perfectly feasible even for large numbers of observations.\\nUnfortunately computing the log-likelihood is equally infeasible: for decreas-\\ningrthe only surviving terms in (2.33) are the functions h((xi\\x00xi)=r) =\\nh(0), since the arguments of all other kernel functions diverge. In other\\nwords, the log-likelihood is maximized when p(x) is peaked exactly at the\\nlocations where we observed the data. The graph on the left of Figure 2.6\\nshows what happens in such a situation.\\nWhat we just experienced is a case of over\\x0ctting where our model is too\\n\\rexible. This led to a situation where our model was able to explain the\\nobserved data \\\\unreasonably well\", simply because we were able to adjust\\nour parameters given the data. We will encounter this situation throughout\\nthe book. There exist a number of ways to address this problem.\\nValidation Set: We could use a subset of our set of observations as an\\nestimate of the log-likelihood. That is, we could partition the obser-\\nvations into X:=fx1;:::;xngandX0:=fxn+1;:::;xmgand use\\nthe second part for a likelihood score according to (2.33). The second\\nset is typically called a validation set .\\nn-fold Cross-validation: Taking this idea further, note that there is no\\nparticular reason why any given xishould belong to XorX0respec-\\ntively. In fact, we could use all splits of the observations into sets\\nXandX0to infer the quality of our estimate. While this is compu-\\ntationally infeasible, we could decide to split the observations into\\nnequally sized subsets, say X1;:::;Xnand use each of them as a\\nvalidation set at a time while the remainder is used to generate a\\ndensity estimate.\\nTypicallynis chosen to be 10, in which case this procedure is2.2 Parzen Windows 57\\nreferred to as 10-fold cross-validation . It is a computationally at-\\ntractive procedure insofar as it does not require us to change the\\nbasic estimation algorithm. Nonetheless, computation can be costly.\\nLeave-one-out Estimator: At the extreme end of cross-validation we could\\nchoosen=m. That is, we only remove a single observation at a time\\nand use the remainder of the data for the estimate. Using the average\\nover the likelihood scores provides us with an even more \\x0cne-grained\\nestimate. Denote by pi(x) the density estimate obtained by using\\nX:=fx1;:::;xmgwithoutxi. For a Parzen windows estimate this\\nis given by\\npi(xi) = (m\\x001)\\x001X\\nj6=ir\\x00dh\\x10xi\\x00xj\\nr\\x11\\n=m\\nm\\x001h\\np(xi)\\x00r\\x00dh(0)i\\n:\\n(2.34)\\nNote that this is precisely the term r\\x00dh(0) that is removed from\\nthe estimate. It is this term which led to divergent estimates for\\nr!0. This means that the leave-one-out log-likelihood estimate\\ncan be computed easily via\\nL(X) =mlogm\\nm\\x001+mX\\ni=1logh\\np(xi)\\x00r\\x00dh(0)i\\n: (2.35)\\nWe then choose rsuch thatL(X) is maximized. This strategy is very\\nrobust and whenever it can be implemented in a computationally\\ne\\x0ecient manner, it is very reliable in performing model selection.\\nAn alternative, probably more of theoretical interest, is to choose the scale r\\na priori based on the amount of data we have at our disposition. Intuitively,\\nwe need a scheme which ensures that r!0 as the number of observations\\nincreasesm!1 . However, we need to ensure that this happens slowly\\nenough that the number of observations within range rkeeps on increasing in\\norder to ensure good statistical performance. For details we refer the reader\\nto [Sil86]. Chapter ??discusses issues of model selection for estimators in\\ngeneral in considerably more detail.\\n2.2.4 Silverman\\'s Rule\\nAssume you are an aspiring demographer who wishes to estimate the popu-\\nlation density of a country, say Australia. You might have access to a limited\\ncensus which, for a random portion of the population determines where they\\nlive. As a consequence you will obtain a relatively high number of samples58 2 Density Estimation\\nFig. 2.8. Nonuniform density. Left: original density with samples drawn from the\\ndistribution. Middle: density estimate with a uniform kernel. Right: density estimate\\nusing Silverman\\'s adjustment.\\nof city dwellers, whereas the number of people living in the countryside is\\nlikely to be very small.\\nIf we attempt to perform density estimation using Parzen windows, we\\nwill encounter an interesting dilemma: in regions of high density (i.e. the\\ncities) we will want to choose a narrow kernel width to allow us to model\\nthe variations in population density accurately. Conversely, in the outback,\\na very wide kernel is preferable, since the population there is very low.\\nUnfortunately, this information is exactly what a density estimator itself\\ncould tell us. In other words we have a chicken and egg situation where\\nhaving a good density estimate seems to be necessary to come up with a\\ngood density estimate.\\nFortunately this situation can be addressed by realizing that we do not\\nactually need to know the density but rather a rough estimate of the latter.\\nThis can be obtained by using information about the average distance of the\\nknearest neighbors of a point. One of Silverman\\'s rules of thumb [Sil86] is\\nto chooserias\\nri=c\\nkX\\nx2kNN (xi)kx\\x00xik: (2.36)\\nTypicallycis chosen to be 0 :5 andkis small, e.g. k= 9 to ensure that the\\nestimate is computationally e\\x0ecient. The density estimate is then given by\\np(x) =1\\nmmX\\ni=1r\\x00d\\nih\\x10\\nx\\x00xi\\nri\\x11\\n: (2.37)\\nFigure 2.8 shows an example of such a density estimate. It is clear that a\\nlocality dependent kernel width is better than choosing a uniformly constant\\nkernel density estimate. However, note that this increases the computational\\ncomplexity of performing a density estimate, since \\x0crst the knearest neigh-\\nbors need to be found before the density estimate can be carried out.2.2 Parzen Windows 59\\n2.2.5 Watson-Nadaraya Estimator\\nNow that we are able to perform density estimation we may use it to perform\\nclassi\\x0ccation and regression. This leads us to an e\\x0bective method for non-\\nparametric data analysis, the Watson-Nadaraya estimator [Wat64, Nad65].\\nThe basic idea is very simple: assume that we have a binary classi\\x0ccation\\nproblem, i.e. we need to distinguish between two classes. Provided that we\\nare able to compute density estimates p(x) given a set of observations Xwe\\ncould appeal to Bayes rule to obtain\\np(yjx) =p(xjy)p(y)\\np(x)=my\\nm\\x011\\nmyP\\ni:yi=yr\\x00dh\\x00xi\\x00x\\nr\\x01\\n1\\nmPm\\ni=1r\\x00dh\\x00xi\\x00x\\nr\\x01: (2.38)\\nHere we only take the sum over all xiwith labelyi=yin the numerator.\\nThe advantage of this approach is that it is very cheap to design such an\\nestimator. After all, we only need to compute sums. The downside, similar\\nto that of the k-nearest neighbor classi\\x0cer is that it may require sums (or\\nsearch) over a large number of observations. That is, evaluation of (2.38) is\\npotentially an O(m) operation. Fast tree based representations can be used\\nto accelerate this [BKL06, KM00], however their behavior depends signi\\x0c-\\ncantly on the dimensionality of the data. We will encounter computationally\\nmore attractive methods at a later stage.\\nFor binary classi\\x0ccation (2.38) can be simpli\\x0ced considerably. Assume\\nthaty2f\\x06 1g. Forp(y= 1jx)>0:5 we will choose that we should estimate\\ny= 1 and in the converse case we would estimate y=\\x001. Taking the\\ndi\\x0berence between twice the numerator and the denominator we can see\\nthat the function\\nf(x) =P\\niyih\\x00xi\\x00x\\nr\\x01\\nP\\nih\\x00xi\\x00x\\nr\\x01=X\\niyih\\x00xi\\x00x\\nr\\x01\\nP\\nih\\x00xi\\x00x\\nr\\x01=:X\\niyiwi(x) (2.39)\\ncan be used to achieve the same goal since f(x)>0()p(y= 1jx)>0:5.\\nNote thatf(x) is a weighted combination of the labels yiassociated with\\nweightswi(x) which depend on the proximity of xto an observation xi.\\nIn other words, (2.39) is a smoothed-out version of the k-nearest neighbor\\nclassi\\x0cer of Section 1.3.2. Instead of drawing a hard boundary at the kclosest\\nobservation we use a soft weighting scheme with weights wi(x) depending\\non which observations are closest.\\nNote furthermore that the numerator of (2.39) is very similar to the simple\\nclassi\\x0cer of Section 1.3.3. In fact, for kernels k(x;x0) such as the Gaussian\\nRBF kernel, which are also kernels in the sense of a Parzen windows den-\\nsity estimate, i.e. k(x;x0) =r\\x00dh\\x10\\nx\\x00x0\\nr\\x11\\nthe two terms are identical. This60 2 Density Estimation\\nFig. 2.9. Watson Nadaraya estimate. Left: a binary classi\\x0cer. The optimal solution\\nwould be a straight line since both classes were drawn from a normal distribution\\nwith the same variance. Right: a regression estimator. The data was generated from\\na sinusoid with additive noise. The regression tracks the sinusoid reasonably well.\\nmeans that the Watson Nadaraya estimator provides us with an alternative\\nexplanation as to why (1.24) leads to a usable classi\\x0cer.\\nIn the same fashion as the Watson Nadaraya classi\\x0cer extends the k-\\nnearest neighbor classi\\x0cer we also may construct a Watson Nadaraya re-\\ngression estimator by replacing the binary labels yiby real-valued values\\nyi2Rto obtain the regression estimatorP\\niyiwi(x). Figure 2.9 has an ex-\\nample of the workings of both a regression estimator and a classi\\x0cer. They\\nare easy to use and they work well for moderately dimensional data.\\n2.3 Exponential Families\\nDistributions from the exponential family are some of the most versatile\\ntools for statistical inference. Gaussians, Poisson, Gamma and Wishart dis-\\ntributions all form part of the exponential family. They play a key role in\\ndealing with graphical models, classi\\x0ccation, regression and conditional ran-\\ndom \\x0celds which we will encounter in later parts of this book. Some of the\\nreasons for their popularity are that they lead to convex optimization prob-\\nlems and that they allow us to describe probability distributions by linear\\nmodels.\\n2.3.1 Basics\\nDensities from the exponential family are de\\x0cned by\\np(x;\\x12) :=p0(x) exp (h\\x1e(x);\\x12i\\x00g(\\x12)): (2.40)2.3 Exponential Families 61\\nHerep0(x) is a density on Xand is often called the base measure, \\x1e(x) is\\na map from xto the su\\x0ecient statistics \\x1e(x).\\x12is commonly referred to as\\nthenatural parameter. It lives in the space dual to \\x1e(x). Moreover, g(\\x12) is a\\nnormalization constant which ensures that p(x) is properly normalized. gis\\noften referred to as the log-partition function. The name stems from physics\\nwhereZ=eg(\\x12)denotes the number of states of a physical ensemble. gcan\\nbe computed as follows:\\ng(\\x12) = logZ\\nXexp (h\\x1e(x);\\x12i)dx: (2.41)\\nExample 2.5 (Binary Model) Assume that X=f0; 1gand that\\x1e(x) =\\nx. In this case we have g(\\x12) = log\\x02\\ne0+e\\x12\\x03\\n= log\\x02\\n1 +e\\x12\\x03\\n. It follows that\\np(x= 0;\\x12) =1\\n1+e\\x12andp(x= 1;\\x12) =e\\x12\\n1+e\\x12. In other words, by choosing\\ndi\\x0berent values of \\x12one can recover di\\x0berent Bernoulli distributions.\\nOne of the convenient properties of exponential families is that the log-\\npartition function gcan be used to generate moments of the distribution\\nitself simply by taking derivatives.\\nTheorem 2.14 (Log partition function) The function g(\\x12)is convex.\\nMoreover, the distribution p(x;\\x12)satis\\x0ces\\nr\\x12g(\\x12) =Ex[\\x1e(x)]andr2\\n\\x12g(\\x12) = Varx[\\x1e(x)]: (2.42)\\nProof Note thatr2\\n\\x12g(\\x12) = Varx[\\x1e(x)] implies that gis convex, since the\\ncovariance matrix is positive semide\\x0cnite. To show (2.42) we expand\\nr\\x12g(\\x12) =R\\nX\\x1e(x) exph\\x1e(x);\\x12idxR\\nXexph\\x1e(x);\\x12i=Z\\n\\x1e(x)p(x;\\x12)dx=Ex[\\x1e(x)]:(2.43)\\nNext we take the second derivative to obtain\\nr2\\n\\x12g(\\x12) =Z\\nX\\x1e(x) [\\x1e(x)\\x00r\\x12g(\\x12)]>p(x;\\x12)dx (2.44)\\n=Exh\\n\\x1e(x)\\x1e(x)>i\\n\\x00Ex[\\x1e(x)]Ex[\\x1e(x)]>(2.45)\\nwhich proves the claim. For the \\x0crst equality we used (2.43). For the second\\nline we used the de\\x0cnition of the variance.\\nOne may show that higher derivatives rn\\n\\x12g(\\x12) generate higher order cu-\\nmulants of \\x1e(x) underp(x;\\x12). This is why gis often also referred as the\\ncumulant-generating function. Note that in general, computation of g(\\x12)62 2 Density Estimation\\nis nontrivial since it involves solving a highdimensional integral. For many\\ncases, in fact, the computation is NP hard, for instance when Xis the do-\\nmain of permutations [FJ95]. Throughout the book we will discuss a number\\nof approximation techniques which can be applied in such a case.\\nLet us brie\\ry illustrate (2.43) using the binary model of Example 2.5.\\nWe have thatr\\x12=e\\x12\\n1+e\\x12andr2\\n\\x12=e\\x12\\n(1+e\\x12)2:This is exactly what we would\\nhave obtained from direct computation of the mean p(x= 1;\\x12) and variance\\np(x= 1;\\x12)\\x00p(x= 1;\\x12)2subject to the distribution p(x;\\x12).\\n2.3.2 Examples\\nA large number of densities are members of the exponential family. Note,\\nhowever, that in statistics it is not common to express them in the dot\\nproduct formulation for historic reasons and for reasons of notational com-\\npactness. We discuss a number of common densities below and show why\\nthey can be written in terms of an exponential family.

By combining the\\nterms inxinto\\x1e(x) := (x;\\x001\\n2xx>) we obtain the su\\x0ecient statistics\\nofx. The corresponding linear coe\\x0ecients (\\x06\\x001\\x16;\\x06\\x001) constitute the\\nnatural parameter \\x12. All that remains to be done to express p(x) in\\nterms of (2.40) is to rewrite g(\\x12) in terms of c(\\x16;\\x06). The summary\\ntable on the following page contains details.\\nMultinomial Another popular distribution is one over kdiscrete events.\\nIn this case X=f1;:::;kgand we have in completely generic terms\\np(x) =\\x19xwhere\\x19x\\x150 andP\\nx\\x19x= 1. Now denote by ex2Rkthe\\nx-th unit vector of the canonical basis, that is hex;ex0i= 1 ifx=x0\\nand 0 otherwise. In this case we may rewrite p(x) via\\np(x) =\\x19x= exp (hex;log\\x19i) (2.47)\\nwhere log\\x19= (log\\x191;:::; log\\x19k). In other words, we have succeeded2.3 Exponential Families 63\\nin rewriting the distribution as a member of the exponential family\\nwhere\\x1e(x) =exand where\\x12= log\\x19. Note that in this de\\x0cnition \\x12\\nis restricted to a k\\x001 dimensional manifold (the kdimensional prob-\\nability simplex). If we relax those constraints we need to ensure that\\np(x) remains normalized. Details are given in the summary table.\\nPoisson This distribution is often used to model distributions over discrete\\nevents. For instance, the number of raindrops which fall on a given\\nsurface area in a given amount of time, the number of stars in a\\ngiven volume of space, or the number of Prussian soldiers killed by\\nhorse-kicks in the Prussian cavalry all follow this distribution. It is\\ngiven by\\np(x) =e\\x00\\x15\\x15x\\nx!=1\\nx!exp (xlog\\x15\\x00\\x15) wherex2N0: (2.48)\\nBy de\\x0cning \\x1e(x) =xwe obtain an exponential families model. Note\\nthat things are a bit less trivial here since1\\nx!is the nonuniform\\ncounting measure onN0. The case of the uniform measure which\\nleads to the exponential distribution is discussed in Problem 2.16.\\nThe reason why many discrete processes follow the Poisson distri-\\nbution is that it can be seen as the limit over the average of a large\\nnumber of Bernoulli draws: denote by z2f0;1ga random variable\\nwithp(z= 1) =\\x0b. Moreover, denote by znthe sum over ndraws\\nfrom this random variable. In this case znfollows the multinomial\\ndistribution with p(zn=k) =\\x00n\\nk\\x01\\n\\x0bk(1\\x00\\x0b)n\\x00k. Now assume that\\nwe letn!1 such that the expected value of znremains constant.\\nThat is, we rescale \\x0b=\\x15\\nn.

For instance, in the context of exponential families, we may want\\nto estimate a parameter ^\\x12such that it is close to the \\\\true\" parameter \\x12\\x03\\nin the distribution. While the problem is fully general, we will describe the\\nrelevant steps in obtaining estimates for the special case of the exponential\\nfamily. This is done for two reasons | \\x0crstly, exponential families are an\\nimportant special case and we will encounter slightly more complex variants\\non the reasoning in later chapters of the book. Secondly, they are of a su\\x0e-\\nciently simple form that we are able to show a range of di\\x0berent techniques.\\nIn more advanced applications only a small subset of those methods may be\\npractically feasible. Hence exponential families provide us with a working\\nexample based on which we can compare the consequences of a number of\\ndi\\x0berent techniques.\\n2.4.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation\\nWhenever we have a distribution p(x;\\x12) parametrized by some parameter\\n\\x12we may use data to \\x0cnd a value of \\x12which maximizes the likelihood that\\nthe data would have been generated by a distribution with this choice of\\nparameter.\\nFor instance, assume that we observe a set of temperature measurements\\nX=fx1;:::;xmg. In this case, we could try \\x0cnding a normal distribution\\nsuch that the likelihood p(X;\\x12) of the data under the assumption of a normal\\ndistribution is maximized. Note that this does notimply in any way that the\\ntemperature measurements are actually drawn from a normal distribution.\\nInstead, it means that we are attempting to \\x0cnd the Gaussian which \\x0cts the\\ndata in the best fashion.\\nWhile this distinction may appear subtle, it is critical: we do notassume\\nthat our model accurately re\\rects reality. Instead, we simply try doing the\\nbest possible job at modeling the data given a speci\\x0ced model class. Later\\nwe will encounter alternative approaches at estimation, namely Bayesian\\nmethods, which make the assumption that our model ought to be able to\\ndescribe the data accurately.\\nDe\\x0cnition 2.16 (Maximum Likelihood Estimator) For a model p(\\x01;\\x12)\\nparametrized by \\x12and observations Xthe maximum likelihood estimator\\n(MLE) is\\n^\\x12ML[X] := argmax\\n\\x12p(X;\\x12): (2.51)2.4 Estimation 67\\nIn the context of exponential families this leads to the following procedure:\\ngivenmobservations drawn iid from some distribution, we can express the\\njoint likelihood as\\np(X;\\x12) =mY\\ni=1p(xi;\\x12) =mY\\ni=1exp (h\\x1e(xi);\\x12i\\x00g(\\x12)) (2.52)\\n= exp (m(h\\x16[X];\\x12i\\x00g(\\x12))) (2.53)\\nwhere\\x16[X] :=1\\nmmX\\ni=1\\x1e(xi): (2.54)\\nHere\\x16[X] is the empirical average of the map \\x1e(x). Maximization of p(X;\\x12)\\nis equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood \\x00logp(X;\\x12). The\\nlatter is a common practical choice since for independently drawn data,\\nthe product of probabilities decomposes into the sum of the logarithms of\\nindividual likelihoods. This leads to the following objective function to be\\nminimized\\n\\x00logp(X;\\x12) =m[g(\\x12)\\x00h\\x12;\\x16[X]i] (2.55)\\nSinceg(\\x12) is convex andh\\x12;\\x16[X]iis linear in\\x12, it follows that minimization\\nof (2.55) is a convex optimization problem. Using Theorem 2.14 and the \\x0crst\\norder optimality condition r\\x12g(\\x12) =\\x16[X] for (2.55) implies that\\n\\x12= [r\\x12g]\\x001(\\x16[X]) or equivalently Ex\\x18p(x;\\x12)[\\x1e(x)] =r\\x12g(\\x12) =\\x16[X]:\\n(2.56)\\nPut another way, the above conditions state that we aim to \\x0cnd the distribu-\\ntionp(x;\\x12) which has the same expected value of \\x1e(x) as what we observed\\nempirically via \\x16[X]. Under very mild technical conditions a solution to\\n(2.56) exists.\\nIn general, (2.56) cannot be solved analytically. In certain special cases,\\nthough, this is easily possible. We discuss two such choices in the following:\\nMultinomial and Poisson distributions.\\nExample 2.6 (Poisson Distribution) For the Poisson distribution1where\\np(x;\\x12) =1\\nx!exp(\\x12x\\x00e\\x12)it follows that g(\\x12) =e\\x12and\\x1e(x) =x. This allows\\n1Often the Poisson distribution is speci\\x0ced using \\x15:= log\\x12as its rate parameter. In this case we\\nhavep(x;\\x15) =\\x15xe\\x00\\x15=x! as its parametrization. The advantage of the natural parametrization\\nusing\\x12is that we can directly take advantage of the properties of the log-partition function as\\ngenerating the cumulants of x.68 2 Density Estimation\\nus to solve (2.56) in closed form using\\nr\\x12g(\\x12) =e\\x12=1\\nmmX\\ni=1xiand hence\\x12= logmX\\ni=1xi\\x00logm: (2.57)\\nExample 2.7 (Multinomial Distribution) For the multinomial distri-\\nbution the log-partition function is given by g(\\x12) = logPN\\ni=1e\\x12i, hence we\\nhave that\\nrig(\\x12) =e\\x12i\\nPN\\nj=1e\\x12j=1\\nmmX\\nj=1fxj=ig: (2.58)\\nIt is easy to check that (2.58) is satis\\x0ced for e\\x12i=Pm\\nj=1fxj=ig. In other\\nwords, the MLE for a discrete distribution simply given by the empirical\\nfrequencies of occurrence.\\nThe multinomial setting also exhibits two rather important aspects of ex-\\nponential families: \\x0crstly, choosing \\x12i=c+ logPm\\ni=1fxj=igfor anyc2R\\nwill lead to an equivalent distribution. This is the case since the su\\x0ecient\\nstatistic\\x1e(x) is not minimal. In our context this means that the coordinates\\nof\\x1e(x) are linearly dependent | for any xwe have thatP\\nj[\\x1e(x)]j= 1,\\nhence we could eliminate one dimension. This is precisely the additional\\ndegree of freedom which is re\\rected in the scaling freedom in \\x12.\\nSecondly, for data where some events do not occur at all, the expression\\nloghPm\\nj=1fxj=igi\\n= log 0 is ill de\\x0cned. This is due to the fact that this\\nparticular set of counts occurs on the boundary of the convex set within\\nwhich the natural parameters \\x12are well de\\x0cned. We will see how di\\x0berent\\ntypes of priors can alleviate the issue.\\nUsing the MLE is not without problems. As we saw in Figure 2.1, conver-\\ngence can be slow, since we are not using any side information. The latter\\ncan provide us with problems which are both numerically better conditioned\\nand which show better convergence, provided that our assumptions are ac-\\ncurate . Before discussing a Bayesian approach to estimation, let us discuss\\nbasic statistical properties of the estimator.\\n2.4.2 Bias, Variance and Consistency\\nWhen designing any estimator ^\\x12(X) we would like to obtain a number of\\ndesirable properties: in general it should not be biased towards a particular\\nsolution unless we have good reason to believe that this solution should\\nbe preferred. Instead, we would like the estimator to recover, at least on2.4 Estimation 69\\naverage, the \\\\correct\" parameter, should it exist. This can be formalized in\\nthe notion of an unbiased estimator.\\nSecondly, we would like that, even if no correct parameter can be found,\\ne.g. when we are trying to \\x0ct a Gaussian distribution to data which is not\\nnormally distributed, that we will converge to the best possible parameter\\nchoice as we obtain more data. This is what is understood by consistency .\\nFinally, we would like the estimator to achieve low bias and near-optimal\\nestimates as quickly as possible. The latter is measured by the e\\x0eciency\\nof an estimator. In this context we will encounter the Cram\\x13 er-Rao bound\\nwhich controls the best possible rate at which an estimator can achieve this\\ngoal. Figure 2.11 gives a pictorial description.\\nFig. 2.11. Left: unbiased estimator; the estimates, denoted by circles have as mean\\nthe true parameter, as denoted by a star. Middle: consistent estimator. While the\\ntrue model is not within the class we consider (as denoted by the ellipsoid), the\\nestimates converge to the white star which is the best model within the class that\\napproximates the true model, denoted by the solid star. Right: di\\x0berent estimators\\nhave di\\x0berent regions of uncertainty, as made explicit by the ellipses around the\\ntrue parameter (solid star).\\nDe\\x0cnition 2.17 (Unbiased Estimator) An estimator ^\\x12[X]is unbiased\\nif for all\\x12where X\\x18p(X;\\x12)we have EX[^\\x12[X]] =\\x12.\\nIn other words, in expectation the parameter estimate matches the true pa-\\nrameter. Note that this only makes sense if a true parameter actually exists .\\nFor instance, if the data is Poisson distributed and we attempt modeling it\\nby a Gaussian we will obviously not obtain unbiased estimates.\\nFor \\x0cnite sample sizes MLE is often biased . For instance, for the normal\\ndistribution the variance estimates carry bias O(m\\x001). See problem 2.19\\nfor details. In general, under fairly mild conditions, MLE is asymptotically\\nunbiased [DGL96]. We prove this for exponential families. For more general\\nsettings the proof depends on the dimensionality and smoothness of the\\nfamily of densities that we have at our disposition.70 2 Density Estimation\\nTheorem 2.18 (MLE for Exponential Families) Assume that Xis an\\nm-sample drawn iid from p(x;\\x12). The estimate ^\\x12[X] =g\\x001(\\x16[X])is asymp-\\ntotically normal with\\nm\\x001\\n2[^\\x12[X]\\x00\\x12]!N(0;\\x02\\nr2\\n\\x12g(\\x12)\\x03\\x001): (2.59)\\nIn other words, the estimate ^\\x12[X] is asymptotically normal, it converges to\\nthe true parameter \\x12, and moreover, the variance at the correct parameter\\nis given by the inverse of the covariance matrix of the data, as given by the\\nsecond derivative of the log-partition function r2\\n\\x12g(\\x12).\\nProof Denote by\\x16=r\\x12g(\\x12) the true mean. Moreover, note that r2\\n\\x12g(\\x12) is\\nthe covariance of the data drawn from p(x;\\x12). By the central limit theorem\\n(Theorem 2.3) we have that n\\x001\\n2[\\x16[X]\\x00\\x16]!N(0;r2\\n\\x12g(\\x12)).\\nNow note that ^\\x12[X] = [r\\x12g]\\x001(\\x16[X]). Therefore, by the delta method\\n(Theorem 2.5) we know that ^\\x12[X] is also asymptotically normal. Moreover,\\nby the inverse function theorem the Jacobian of g\\x001satis\\x0cesr\\x16[r\\x12g]\\x001(\\x16) =\\x02\\nr2\\n\\x12g(\\x12)\\x03\\x001. Applying Slutsky\\'s theorem (Theorem 2.4) proves the claim.\\nNow that we established the asymptotic properties of the MLE for exponen-\\ntial families it is only natural to ask how much variation one may expect in\\n^\\x12[X] when performing estimation. The Cramer-Rao bound governs this.\\nTheorem 2.19 (Cram\\x13 er and Rao [Rao73]) Assume that Xis drawn from\\np(X;\\x12)and let ^\\x12[X]be an asymptotically unbiased estimator. Denote by I\\nthe Fisher information matrix and by Bthe variance of ^\\x12[X]where\\nI:= Cov [r\\x12logp(X;\\x12)]andB:= Varh\\n^\\x12[X]i\\n: (2.60)\\nIn this case detIB\\x151for all estimators ^\\x12[X].\\nProof We prove the claim for the scalar case. The extension to matrices is\\nstraightforward. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have\\nCov2h\\nr\\x12logp(X;\\x12);^\\x12[X]i\\n\\x14Var [r\\x12logp(X;\\x12)] Varh\\n^\\x12[X]i\\n=IB: (2.61)\\nNote that at the true parameter the expected log-likelihood score vanishes\\nEX[r\\x12logp(X;\\x12)] =r\\x12Z\\np(X;\\x12)dX=r\\x121 = 0: (2.62)2.4 Estimation 71\\nHence we may simplify the covariance formula by dropping the means via\\nCovh\\nr\\x12logp(X;\\x12);^\\x12[X]i\\n=EXh\\nr\\x12logp(X;\\x12)^\\x12[X]i\\n=Z\\np(X;\\x12)^\\x12(X)r\\x12logp(X;\\x12)d\\x12\\n=r\\x12Z\\np(X;\\x12)^\\x12(X)dX=r\\x12\\x12= 1:\\nHere the last equality follows since we may interchange integration by X\\nand the derivative with respect to \\x12.\\nThe Cram\\x13 er-Rao theorem implies that there is a limit to how well we may\\nestimate a parameter given \\x0cnite amounts of data. It is also a yardstick by\\nwhich we may measure how e\\x0eciently an estimator uses data. Formally, we\\nde\\x0cne the e\\x0eciency as the quotient between actual performance and the\\nCram\\x13 er-Rao bound via\\ne:= 1=detIB: (2.63)\\nThe closer eis to 1, the lower the variance of the corresponding estimator\\n^\\x12(X). Theorem 2.18 implies that for exponential families MLE is asymptot-\\nically e\\x0ecient. It turns out to be generally true.\\nTheorem 2.20 (E\\x0eciency of MLE [Cra46, GW92, Ber85]) The max-\\nimum likelihood estimator is asymptotically e\\x0ecient ( e= 1).\\nSo far we only discussed the behavior of ^\\x12[X] whenever there exists a true\\x12\\ngeneratingp(\\x12;X). If this is not true, we need to settle for less: how well ^\\x12[X]\\napproaches the best possible choice of within the given model class. Such\\nbehavior is referred to as consistency. Note that it is not possible to de\\x0cne\\nconsistency per se . For instance, we may ask whether ^\\x12converges to the\\noptimal parameter \\x12\\x03, or whether p(x;^\\x12) converges to the optimal density\\np(x;\\x12\\x03), and with respect to which norm. Under fairly general conditions\\nthis turns out to be true for \\x0cnite-dimensional parameters and smoothly\\nparametrized densities. See [DGL96, vdG00] for proofs and further details.\\n2.4.3 A Bayesian Approach\\nThe analysis of the Maximum Likelihood method might suggest that in-\\nference is a solved problem. After all, in the limit, MLE is unbiased and it\\nexhibits as small variance as possible. Empirical results using a \\x0cnite amount\\nof data, as present in Figure 2.1 indicate otherwise.\\nWhile not making any assumptions can lead to interesting and general72 2 Density Estimation\\ntheorems, it ignores the fact that in practice we almost always have some\\nidea about what to expect of our solution. It would be foolish to ignore such\\nadditional information. For instance, when trying to determine the voltage\\nof a battery, it is reasonable to expect a measurement in the order of 1 :5V\\nor less. Consequently such prior knowledge should be incorporated into the\\nestimation process. In fact, the use of side information to guide estimation\\nturns out to be thetool to building estimators which work well in high\\ndimensions.\\nRecall Bayes\\' rule (1.15) which states that p(\\x12jx) =p(xj\\x12)p(\\x12)\\np(x). In our con-\\ntext this means that if we are interested in the posterior probability of \\x12\\nassuming a particular value, we may obtain this using the likelihood (often\\nreferred to as evidence) of xhaving been generated by \\x12viap(xj\\x12) and our\\nprior belief p(\\x12) that\\x12might be chosen in the distribution generating x.\\nObserve the subtle but important di\\x0berence to MLE: instead of treating \\x12\\nas a parameter of a density model, we treat \\x12as an unobserved random\\nvariable which we may attempt to infer given the observations X.\\nThis can be done for a number of di\\x0berent purposes: we might want to\\ninfer the most likely value of the parameter given the posterior distribution\\np(\\x12jX). This is achieved by\\n^\\x12MAP(X) := argmax\\n\\x12p(\\x12jX) = argmin\\n\\x12\\x00logp(Xj\\x12)\\x00logp(\\x12): (2.64)\\nThe second equality follows since p(X) does not depend on \\x12. This estimator\\nis also referred to as the Maximum a Posteriori , or MAP estimator. It di\\x0bers\\nfrom the maximum likelihood estimator by adding the negative log-prior\\nto the optimization problem. For this reason it is sometimes also referred\\nto as Penalized MLE. E\\x0bectively we are penalizing unlikely choices \\x12via\\n\\x00logp(\\x12).\\nNote that using ^\\x12MAP(X) as the parameter of choice is not quite accurate.\\nAfter all, we can only infer a distribution over \\x12and in general there is no\\nguarantee that the posterior is indeed concentrated around its mode. A more\\naccurate treatment is to use the distribution p(\\x12jX) directly via\\np(xjX) =Z\\np(xj\\x12)p(\\x12jX)d\\x12: (2.65)\\nIn other words, we integrate out the unknown parameter \\x12and obtain the\\ndensity estimate directly. As we will see, it is generally impossible to solve\\n(2.65) exactly, an important exception being conjugate priors. In the other\\ncases one may resort to sampling from the posterior distribution to approx-\\nimate the integral.\\nWhile it is possible to design a wide variety of prior distributions, this book2.4 Estimation 73\\nfocuses on two important families: norm-constrained prior and conjugate\\npriors. We will encounter them throughout, the former sometimes in the\\nguise of regularization and Gaussian Processes, the latter in the context of\\nexchangeable models such as the Dirichlet Process.\\nNorm-constrained priors take on the form\\np(\\x12)/exp(\\x00\\x15k\\x12\\x00\\x120kd\\np) forp;d\\x151 and\\x15>0: (2.66)\\nThat is, they restrict the deviation of the parameter value \\x12from some guess\\n\\x120. The intuition is that extreme values of \\x12are much less likely than more\\nmoderate choices of \\x12which will lead to more smooth and even distributions\\np(xj\\x12).\\nA popular choice is the Gaussian prior which we obtain for p=d= 1\\nand\\x15= 1=2\\x1b2. Typically one sets \\x120= 0 in this case. Note that in (2.66)\\nwe did not spell out the normalization of p(\\x12) | in the context of MAP\\nestimation this is not needed since it simply becomes a constant o\\x0bset in\\nthe optimization problem (2.64). We have\\n^\\x12MAP[X] = argmin\\n\\x12m[g(\\x12)\\x00h\\x12;\\x16[X]i] +\\x15k\\x12\\x00\\x120kd\\np (2.67)\\nFord;p\\x151 and\\x15\\x150 the resulting optimization problem is convex and it\\nhas a unique solution. Moreover, very e\\x0ecient algorithms exist to solve this\\nproblem. We will discuss this in detail in Chapter 3. Figure 2.12 shows the\\nregions of equal prior probability for a range of di\\x0berent norm-constrained\\npriors.\\nAs can be seen from the diagram, the choice of the norm can have profound\\nconsequences on the solution. That said, as we will show in Chapter ??, the\\nestimate ^\\x12MAP is well concentrated and converges to the optimal solution\\nunder fairly general conditions.\\nAn alternative to norm-constrained priors are conjugate priors. They are\\ndesigned such that the posterior p(\\x12jX) has the same functional form as the\\npriorp(\\x12). In exponential families such priors are de\\x0cned via\\np(\\x12jn;\\x17) = exp (hn\\x17;\\x12i\\x00ng(\\x12)\\x00h(\\x17;n)) where (2.68)\\nh(\\x17;n) = logZ\\nexp (hn\\x17;\\x12i\\x00ng(\\x12))d\\x12: (2.69)\\nNote thatp(\\x12jn;\\x17) itself is a member of the exponential family with the\\nfeature map \\x1e(\\x12) = (\\x12;\\x00g(\\x12)). Henceh(\\x17;n) isconvex in (n\\x17;n ). Moreover,\\nthe posterior distribution has the form\\np(\\x12jX)/p(Xj\\x12)p(\\x12jn;\\x17)/exp (hm\\x16[X] +n\\x17;\\x12i\\x00(m+n)g(\\x12)):(2.70)74 2 Density Estimation\\nFig. 2.12. From left to right: regions of equal prior probability in R2for priors using\\nthe`1,`2and`1norm. Note that only the `2norm is invariant with regard to the\\ncoordinate system. As we shall see later, the `1norm prior leads to solutions where\\nonly a small number of coordinates is nonzero.\\nThat is, the posterior distribution has the same form as a conjugate prior\\nwith parametersm\\x16[X]+n\\x17\\nm+nandm+n. In other words, nacts like a phantom\\nsample size and \\x17is the corresponding mean parameter. Such an interpreta-\\ntion is reasonable given our desire to design a prior which, when combined\\nwith the likelihood remains in the same model class: we treat prior knowl-\\nedge as having observed virtual data beforehand which is then added to the\\nactual set of observations. In this sense data and prior become completely\\nequivalent | we obtain our knowledge either from actual observations or\\nfrom virtual observations which describe our belief into how the data gen-\\neration process is supposed to behave.\\nEq. (2.70) has the added bene\\x0ct of allowing us to provide an exact nor-\\nmalized version of the posterior. Using (2.68) we obtain that\\np(\\x12jX) = exp\\x10\\nhm\\x16[X] +n\\x17;\\x12i\\x00(m+n)g(\\x12)\\x00h\\x10\\nm\\x16[X]+n\\x17\\nm+n;m+n\\x11\\x11\\n:\\nThe main remaining challenge is to compute the normalization hfor a range\\nof important conjugate distributions. The table on the following page pro-\\nvides details. Besides attractive algebraic properties, conjugate priors also\\nhave a second advantage | the integral (2.65) can be solved exactly:\\np(xjX) =Z\\nexp (h\\x1e(x);\\x12i\\x00g(\\x12))\\x02\\nexp\\x10\\nhm\\x16[X] +n\\x17;\\x12i\\x00(m+n)g(\\x12)\\x00h\\x10\\nm\\x16[X]+n\\x17\\nm+n;m+n\\x11\\x11\\nd\\x12\\nCombining terms one may check that the integrand amounts to the normal-2.4 Estimation 75\\nization in the conjugate distribution, albeit \\x1e(x) added.

[GS04] use the fact that \\x12\\ncan be integrated out to obtain what is called a collapsed Gibbs sampler for\\ntopic models [BNJ03].\\n2.4.4 An Example\\nAssume we would like to build a language model based on available doc-\\numents. For instance, a linguist might be interested in estimating the fre-\\nquency of words in Shakespeare\\'s collected works, or one might want to\\ncompare the change with respect to a collection of webpages. While mod-\\nels describing documents by treating them as bags of words which all have\\nbeen obtained independently of each other are exceedingly simple, they are\\nvaluable for quick-and-dirty content \\x0cltering and categorization, e.g. a spam\\n\\x0clter on a mail server or a content \\x0clter for webpages.\\nHence we model a document das a multinomial distribution: denote by\\nwifori2 f1;:::;mdgthe words in d. Moreover, denote by p(wj\\x12) the\\nprobability of occurrence of word w, then under the assumption that the\\nwords are independently drawn, we have\\np(dj\\x12) =mdY\\ni=1p(wij\\x12): (2.71)\\nIt is our goal to \\x0cnd parameters \\x12such thatp(dj\\x12) is accurate. For a given\\ncollectionDof documents denote by mwthe number of counts for word w\\nin the entire collection. Moreover, denote by mthe total number of words\\nin the entire collection. In this case we have\\np(Dj\\x12) =Y\\nip(dij\\x12) =Y\\nwp(wj\\x12)mw: (2.72)\\nFinding suitable parameters \\x12givenDproceeds as follows: In a maximum\\nlikelihood model we set\\np(wj\\x12) =mw\\nm: (2.73)\\nIn other words, we use the empirical frequency of occurrence as our best\\nguess and the su\\x0ecient statistic of Dis\\x1e(w) =ew, whereewdenotes the unit\\nvector which is nonzero only for the \\\\coordinate\" w. Hence\\x16[D]w=mw\\nm.76 2 Density Estimation\\nWe know that the conjugate prior of the multinomial model is a Dirichlet\\nmodel. It follows from (2.70) that the posterior mode is obtained by replacing\\n\\x16[D] bym\\x16[D]+n\\x17\\nm+n. Denote by nw:=\\x17w\\x01nthe pseudo-counts arising from\\nthe conjugate prior with parameters ( \\x17;n). In this case we will estimate the\\nprobability of the word was\\np(wj\\x12) =mw+nw\\nm+n=mw+n\\x17w\\nm+n: (2.74)\\nIn other words, we add the pseudo counts nwto the actual word counts mw.\\nThis is particularly useful when the document we are dealing with is brief,\\nthat is, whenever we have little data: it is quite unreasonable to infer from\\na webpage of approximately 1000 words that words not occurring in this\\npage have zero probability. This is exactly what is mitigated by means of\\nthe conjugate prior ( \\x17;n).\\nFinally, let us consider norm-constrained priors of the form (2.66). In this\\ncase, the integral required for\\np(D) =Z\\np(Dj\\x12)p(\\x12)d\\x12\\n/Z\\nexp\\x10\\n\\x00\\x15k\\x12\\x00\\x120kd\\np+mh\\x16[D];\\x12i\\x00mg(\\x12)\\x11\\nd\\x12\\nisintractable and we need to resort to an approximation. A popular choice\\nis to replace the integral by p(Dj\\x12\\x03) where\\x12\\x03maximizes the integrand. This\\nis precisely the MAP approximation of (2.64). Hence, in order to perform\\nestimation we need to solve\\nminimize\\n\\x12g(\\x12)\\x00h\\x16[D];\\x12i+\\x15\\nmk\\x12\\x00\\x120kd\\np: (2.75)\\nA very simple strategy for minimizing (2.75) is gradient descent.

Now let us turn to\\nthe converse problem, that is, how to generate random variables given the\\nunderlying probability density. In other words, we want to design a random\\nvariable generator. This is useful for a number of reasons:\\nWe may encounter probability distributions where optimization over suit-\\nable model parameters is essentially impossible and where it is equally im-\\npossible to obtain a closed form expression of the distribution. In these cases\\nit may still be possible to perform sampling to draw examples of the kind\\nof data we expect to see from the model. Chapter ??discusses a number of\\ngraphical models where this problem arises.\\nSecondly, assume that we are interested in testing the performance of a\\nnetwork router under di\\x0berent load conditions. Instead of introducing the\\nunder-development router in a live network and wreaking havoc, one could78 2 Density Estimation\\nestimate the probability density of the network tra\\x0ec under various load\\nconditions and build a model. The behavior of the network can then be\\nsimulated by using a probabilistic model. This involves drawing random\\nvariables from an estimated probability distribution.\\nCarrying on, suppose that we generate data packets by sampling and see\\nan anomalous behavior in your router. In order to reproduce and debug\\nthis problem one needs access to the same set of random packets which\\ncaused the problem in the \\x0crst place. In other words, it is often convenient\\nif our random variable generator is reproducible; At \\x0crst blush this seems\\nlike a contradiction. After all, our random number generator is supposed\\nto generate random variables. This is less of a contradiction if we consider\\nhow random numbers are generated in a computer | given a particular\\ninitialization (which typically depends on the state of the system, e.g. time,\\ndisk size, bios checksum, etc.) the random number algorithm produces a\\nsequence of numbers which, for all practical purposes, can be treated as iid.\\nA simple method is the linear congruential generator [PTVF94]\\nxi+1= (axi+b) modc:\\nThe performance of these iterations depends signi\\x0ccantly on the choice of the\\nconstantsa;b;c . For instance, the GNU C compiler uses a= 1103515245 ;b=\\n12345 andc= 232. In general bandcneed to be relatively prime and a\\x001\\nneeds to be divisible by all prime factors of cand by 4. It is very much\\nadvisable notto attempt implementing such generators on one\\'s own unless\\nit is absolutely necessary.\\nUseful desiderata for a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) are that\\nfor practical purposes it is statistically indistinguishable from a sequence of\\niid data. That is, when applying a number of statistical tests, we will accept\\nthe null-hypothesis that the random variables are iid. See Chapter ??for\\na detailed discussion of statistical testing procedures for random variables.\\nIn the following we assume that we have access to a uniform RNGU[0;1]\\nwhich draws random numbers uniformly from the range [0 ;1].\\n2.5.1 Inverse Transformation\\nWe now consider the scenario where we would like to draw from some dis-\\ntinctively non-uniform distribution.

Such a conversion strat-\\negy is particularly useful for univariate distributions.\\nCorollary 2.22 Denote byp(x)a distribution on Rwith cumulative distri-\\nbution function F(x0) =Rx0\\n\\x001dp(x). Then the transformation x=\\x1e(z) =\\nF\\x001(z)converts samples z\\x18U[0;1]to samples drawn from p(x).\\nWe now apply this strategy to a number of univariate distributions. One of\\nthe most common cases is sampling from a discrete distribution.\\nExample 2.8 (Discrete Distribution) In the case of a discrete distribu-\\ntion overf1;:::;kgthe cumulative distribution function is a step-function\\nwith steps atf1;:::;kgwhere the height of each step is given by the corre-\\nsponding probability of the event.\\nThe implementation works as follows: denote by p2[0;1]kthe vector of\\nprobabilities and denote by f2[0;1]kwithfi=fi\\x001+piandf1=p1the\\nsteps of the cumulative distribution function.

Unfortunately, the cumulative distribution\\nfunction of the Gaussian is not available in closed form and we would need\\nresort to rather nontrivial numerical techniques. It turns out that there exists\\na much more elegant algorithm which has its roots in Gauss\\' proof of the\\nnormalization constant of the Normal distribution.

We now describe\\na general purpose method, which can be used to generate samples from an\\narbitrary distribution. Let us begin with sampling from a set:\\nExample 2.12 (Rejection Sampler) Denote byX\\x12Xa set and let pbe\\na density on X. Then a sampler for drawing from pX(x)/p(x)forx2X\\nandpX(x) = 0 forx62X, that is,pX(x) =p(xjx2X)is obtained by the\\nprocedure:\\nrepeat\\ndrawx\\x18p(x)\\nuntilx2X\\nreturnx\\nThat is, the algorithm keeps on drawing from puntil the random variable is\\ncontained in X.

This mathematical convenience came at the expense of a slightly\\nless e\\x0ecient sampler | about 21% of all samples are rejected.\\nThe same reasoning that we used to obtain a hard accept/reject procedure\\ncan be used for a considerably more sophisticated rejection sampler. The\\nbasic idea is that if, for a given distribution pwe can \\x0cnd another distribution\\nqwhich, after rescaling, becomes an upper envelope on p, we can use qto\\nsample from and reject depending on the ratio between qandp.\\nTheorem 2.23 (Rejection Sampler) Denote bypandqdistributions on\\nXand letcbe a constant such that such that cq(x)\\x15p(x)for allx2X.84 2 Density Estimation\\nThen the algorithm below draws from pwith acceptance probability c\\x001.\\nrepeat\\ndrawx\\x18q(x)andt\\x18U[0;1]\\nuntilct\\x14p(x)\\nq(x)\\nreturnx\\nProof Denote by Zthe event that the sample drawn from qis accepted.\\nThen by Bayes rule the probability Pr( xjZ) can be written as follows\\nPr(xjZ) =Pr(Zjx) Pr(x)\\nPr(Z)=p(x)\\ncq(x)\\x01q(x)\\nc\\x001=p(x) (2.85)\\nHere we used that Pr( Z) =R\\nPr(Zjx)q(x)dx=R\\nc\\x001p(x)dx=c\\x001.\\nNote that the algorithm of Example 2.12 is a special case of such a rejection\\nsampler | we majorize pXby the uniform distribution rescaled by1\\np(X).\\nExample 2.14 (Beta distribution) Recall that the Beta(a;b)distribution,\\nas a member of the Exponential Family with su\\x0ecient statistics (logx;log(1\\x00\\nx)), is given by\\np(xja;b) =\\x00(a+b)\\n\\x00(a)\\x00(b)xa\\x001(1\\x00x)b\\x001; (2.86)\\nFor given (a;b)one can verify (problem 2.25) that\\nM:= argmax\\nxp(xja;b) =a\\x001\\na+b\\x002: (2.87)\\nprovideda>1. Hence, if we use as proposal distribution the uniform distri-\\nbutionU[0;1]with scaling factor c=p(Mja;b)we may apply Theorem 2.23.\\nAs illustrated in Figure 2.17, to generate a sample from Beta(a;b)we \\x0crst\\ngenerate a pair (x;t), uniformly at random from the shaded rectangle.

Figure 3.3 depicts this situation graphically.3.1 Preliminaries 95\\nAs we hinted in the introduction of this chapter, minimizing an arbitrary\\nfunction on a (possibly not even compact) set of arguments can be a di\\x0ecult\\ntask, and will most likely exhibit many local minima. In contrast, minimiza-\\ntion of a convex objective function on a convex set exhibits exactly one global\\nminimum. We now prove this property.\\nTheorem 3.5 (Minima on Convex Sets) If the convex function f:X!\\nRattains its minimum, then the set of x2X, for which the minimum value\\nis attained, is a convex set. Moreover, if fis strictly convex, then this set\\ncontains a single element.\\nProof Denote by cthe minimum of fonX. Then the set Xc:=fxjx2\\nXandf(x)\\x14cgis clearly convex.\\nIffis strictly convex, then for any two distinct x;x02Xcand any 0<\\n\\x15<1 we have\\nf(\\x15x+ (1\\x00\\x15)x0)<\\x15f (x) + (1\\x00\\x15)f(x0) =\\x15c+ (1\\x00\\x15)c=c;\\nwhich contradicts the assumption that fattains its minimum on Xc. There-\\nforeXcmust contain only a single element.\\nAs the following lemma shows, the minimum point can be characterized\\nprecisely.\\nLemma 3.6 Letf:X!Rbe a di\\x0berentiable convex function.

On the other hand,\\nd\\nd\\x15f(z(\\x15))\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n\\x15=0=\\nx0\\x00x;rf(x)\\x0b\\n<0;\\nwhich shows that for small values of \\x15we havef(z(\\x15))<f(x), thus showing\\nthatxis not optimal.\\nThe reverse implication follows from (3.7) by noting that f(x0)\\x15f(x),\\nwhenever (3.12) holds.96 3 Optimization\\nOne way to ensure that (3.12) holds is to set rf(x) = 0. In other words,\\nminimizing a convex function is equivalent to \\x0cnding a xsuch thatrf(x) =\\n0. Therefore, the \\x0crst order conditions are both necessary and su\\x0ecient\\nwhen minimizing a convex function.\\n3.1.3 Subgradients\\nSo far, we worked with di\\x0berentiable convex functions. The subgradient is a\\ngeneralization of gradients appropriate for convex functions, including those\\nwhich are not necessarily smooth.\\nDe\\x0cnition 3.7 (Subgradient) Supposexis a point where a convex func-\\ntionfis \\x0cnite. Then a subgradient is the normal vector of any tangential\\nsupporting hyperplane of fatx. Formally \\x16is called a subgradient of fat\\nxif, and only if,\\nf(x0)\\x15f(x) +\\nx0\\x00x;\\x16\\x0b\\nfor allx0: (3.13)\\nThe set of all subgradients at a point is called the subdi\\x0berential, and is de-\\nnoted by@xf(x). If this set is not empty then fis said to be subdi\\x0berentiable\\natx. On the other hand, if this set is a singleton then, the function is said\\nto be di\\x0berentiable atx. In this case we use rf(x) to denote the gradient\\noff. Convex functions are subdi\\x0berentiable everywhere in their domain. We\\nnow state some simple rules of subgradient calculus:\\nAddition @x(f1(x) +f2(x)) =@xf1(x) +@xf2(x)\\nScaling@x\\x0bf(x) =\\x0b@xf(x), for\\x0b>0\\nA\\x0ene Transform Ifg(x) =f(Ax+b) for some matrix Aand vector b,\\nthen@xg(x) =A>@yf(y).\\nPointwise Maximum Ifg(x) = maxifi(x) then@g(x) = conv(@xfi0) where\\ni02argmaxifi(x).\\nThe de\\x0cnition of a subgradient can also be understood geometrically. As\\nillustrated by Figure 3.4, a di\\x0berentiable convex function is always lower\\nbounded by its \\x0crst order Taylor approximation. This concept can be ex-\\ntended to non-smooth functions via subgradients, as Figure 3.5 shows.\\nBy using more involved concepts, the proof of Lemma 3.6 can be extended\\nto subgradients. In this case, minimizing a convex nonsmooth function en-\\ntails \\x0cnding a xsuch that 02@f(x).3.1 Preliminaries 97\\n3.1.4 Strongly Convex Functions\\nWhen analyzing optimization algorithms, it is sometimes easier to work with\\nstrongly convex functions, which generalize the de\\x0cnition of convexity.\\nDe\\x0cnition 3.8 (Strongly Convex Function) A convex function fis\\x1b-\\nstrongly convex if, and only if, there exists a constant \\x1b > 0such that the\\nfunctionf(x)\\x00\\x1b\\n2kxk2is convex.\\nThe constant \\x1bis called the modulus of strong convexity of f. Iffis twice\\ndi\\x0berentiable, then there is an equivalent, and perhaps easier, de\\x0cnition of\\nstrong convexity: fis strongly convex if there exists a \\x1bsuch that\\nr2f(x)\\x17\\x1bI: (3.14)\\nIn other words, the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian of fisuniformly\\nlower bounded by\\x1beverywhere.

As we will see later they are connected by Fenchel\\nduality.\\nDe\\x0cnition 3.9 (Lipschitz Continuous Gradient) A di\\x0berentiable con-\\nvex function fis said to have a Lipschitz continuous gradient, if there exists\\na constantL>0, such that\\n\\r\\rrf(x)\\x00rf(x0)\\r\\r\\x14L\\r\\rx\\x00x0\\r\\r8x;x0: (3.20)\\nAs before, if fis twice di\\x0berentiable, then there is an equivalent, and perhaps\\neasier, de\\x0cnition of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient: fhas a Lipschitz\\ncontinuous gradient strongly convex if there exists a Lsuch that\\nLI\\x17r2f(x): (3.21)\\nIn other words, the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian of fisuniformly upper\\nbounded byLeverywhere.

As we will see later, many optimiza-\\ntion methods \\x0cnd a direction of descent and minimize the objective function\\nalong this direction1; this subroutine is called a line search. Algorithm 3.1\\ndepicts a simple line search routine based on interval bisection.\\nBefore we show that Algorithm 3.1 converges, let us \\x0crst derive an im-\\nportant property of convex functions of one variable. For a di\\x0berentiable\\none-dimensional convex function J(3.7) reduces to\\nJ(w)\\x15J(w0) + (w\\x00w0)\\x01J0(w0); (3.34)\\nwhereJ0(w) denotes the gradient of J. Exchanging the role of wandw0in\\n(3.34), we can write\\nJ(w0)\\x15J(w) + (w0\\x00w)\\x01J0(w): (3.35)\\nAdding the above two equations yields\\n(w\\x00w0)\\x01(J0(w)\\x00J0(w0))\\x150: (3.36)\\nIfw\\x15w0, then this implies that J0(w)\\x15J0(w0). In other words, the gradient\\nof a one dimensional convex function is monotonically non-decreasing.\\nRecall that minimizing a convex function is equivalent to \\x0cnding w\\x03such\\nthatJ0(w\\x03) = 0. Furthermore, it is easy to see that the interval bisection\\nmaintains the invariant J0(at)<0 andJ0(bt)>0. This along with the\\nmonotonicity of the gradient su\\x0eces to ensure that w\\x032(at;bt). Setting\\nw=w\\x03in (3.34), and using the monotonicity of the gradient allows us to\\n1If the objective function is convex, then the one dimensional function obtained by restricting\\nit along the search direction is also convex (Exercise 3.10).104 3 Optimization\\nwrite for any w02(at;bt)\\nJ(w0)\\x00J(w\\x03)\\x14(w0\\x00w\\x03)\\x01J0(w0)\\x14(bt\\x00at)\\x01J0(U): (3.37)\\nSince we halve the interval ( at;bt) at every iteration, it follows that ( bt\\x00at) =\\n(U\\x00L)=2t.

An algorithm which converges to an \\x0faccurate solution in O(log(1=\\x0f))\\niterations is said to be linearly convergent.\\nFor multi-dimensional objective functions, one cannot rely on the mono-\\ntonicity property of the gradient. Therefore, one needs more sophisticated\\noptimization algorithms, some of which we now describe.\\n3.2.2 Coordinate Descent\\nCoordinate descent is conceptually the simplest algorithm for minimizing a\\nmultidimensional smooth convex function J:Rn!R. At every iteration\\nselect a coordinate, say i, and update\\nwt+1=wt\\x00\\x11tei: (3.39)\\nHereeidenotes the i-th basis vector, that is, a vector with one at the i-th co-\\nordinate and zeros everywhere else, while \\x11t2Ris a non-negative scalar step\\nsize. One could, for instance, minimize the one dimensional convex function\\nJ(wt\\x00\\x11ei) to obtain the stepsize \\x11t. The coordinates can either be selected\\ncyclically, that is, 1 ;2;:::;n; 1;2;:::or greedily, that is, the coordinate which\\nyields the maximum reduction in function value.\\nEven though coordinate descent can be shown to converge if Jhas a Lip-\\nschitz continuous gradient [LT92], in practice it can be quite slow. However,\\nif a high precision solution is not required, as is the case in some machine\\nlearning applications, coordinate descent is often used because a) the cost\\nper iteration is very low and b) the speed of convergence may be acceptable\\nespecially if the variables are loosely coupled.\\n3.2.3 Gradient Descent\\nGradient descent (also widely known as steepest descent) is an optimization\\ntechnique for minimizing multidimensional smooth convex objective func-\\ntions of the form J:Rn!R. The basic idea is as follows: Given a location3.2 Unconstrained Smooth Convex Minimization 105\\nwtat iteration t, compute the gradient rJ(wt), and update\\nwt+1=wt\\x00\\x11trJ(wt); (3.40)\\nwhere\\x11tis a scalar stepsize. See Algorithm 3.2 for details. Di\\x0berent variants\\nof gradient descent depend on how \\x11tis chosen:\\nExact Line Search: SinceJ(wt\\x00\\x11rJ(wt)) is a one dimensional convex\\nfunction in \\x11, one can use the Algorithm 3.1 to compute:\\n\\x11t= argmin\\n\\x11J(wt\\x00\\x11rJ(wt)): (3.41)\\nInstead of the simple bisecting line search more sophisticated line searches\\nsuch as the More-Thuente line search or the golden bisection rule can also\\nbe used to speed up convergence (see [NW99] Chapter 3 for an extensive\\ndiscussion).\\nInexact Line Search: Instead of minimizing J(wt\\x00\\x11rJ(wt)) we could\\nsimply look for a stepsize which results in su\\x0ecient decrease in the objective\\nfunction value. One popular set of su\\x0ecient decrease conditions is the Wolfe\\nconditions\\nJ(wt+1)\\x14J(wt) +c1\\x11thrJ(wt);wt+1\\x00wti(su\\x0ecient decrease) (3.42)\\nhrJ(wt+1);wt+1\\x00wti \\x15c2hrJ(wt);wt+1\\x00wti(curvature) (3.43)\\nwith 0<c1<c2<1 (see Figure 3.7).

On\\nthe other hand, if the function is strongly convex, then gradient descent\\nconverges linearly, that is, in O(log(1=\\x0f)) iterations. However, the number108 3 Optimization\\nof iterations depends inversely on log(1 =c). If we approximate log(1 =c) =\\n\\x00log(1\\x00\\x1b=L)\\x19\\x1b=L, then it shows that convergence depends on the ratio\\nL=\\x1b. This ratio is called the condition number of a problem. If the problem\\nis well conditioned, i.e.,\\x1b\\x19Lthen gradient descent converges extremely\\nfast. In contrast, if \\x1b\\x1cLthen gradient descent requires many iterations.\\nThis is best illustrated with an example: Consider the quadratic objective\\nfunction\\nJ(w) =1\\n2w>Aw\\x00bw; (3.48)\\nwhereA2Rn\\x02nis a symmetric positive de\\x0cnite matrix, and b2Rnis any\\narbitrary vector.\\nRecall that a twice di\\x0berentiable function is \\x1b-strongly convex and has a\\nLipschitz continuous gradient with modulus Lif and only if its Hessian sat-\\nis\\x0cesLI\\x17r2J(w)\\x17\\x1bI(see (3.14) and (3.21)). In the case of the quadratic\\nfunction (3.48)r2J(w) =Aand hence\\x1b=\\x15minandL=\\x15max, where\\x15min\\n(respectively \\x15max) denotes the minimum (respectively maximum) eigen-\\nvalue ofA. One can thus change the condition number of the problem by\\nvarying the eigen-spectrum of the matrix A. For instance, if we set Ato\\nthen\\x02nidentity matrix, then \\x15max=\\x15min= 1 and hence the problem is\\nwell conditioned. In this case, gradient descent converges very quickly to the\\noptimal solution. We illustrate this behavior on a two dimensional quadratic\\nfunction in Figure 3.8 (right).\\nOn the other hand, if we choose Asuch that\\x15max\\x1d\\x15minthen the\\nproblem (3.48) becomes ill-conditioned. In this case gradient descent exhibits\\nzigzagging and slow convergence as can be seen in Figure 3.8 (left). Because\\nof these shortcomings, gradient descent is not widely used in practice. A\\nnumber of di\\x0berent algorithms we described below can be understood as\\nexplicitly or implicitly changing the condition number of the problem to\\naccelerate convergence.\\n3.2.4 Mirror Descent\\nOne way to motivate gradient descent is to use the following quadratic ap-\\nproximation of the objective function\\nQt(w) :=J(wt) +hrJ(wt);w\\x00wti+1\\n2(w\\x00wt)>(w\\x00wt); (3.49)\\nwhere, as in the previous section, rJ(\\x01) denotes the gradient of J.

In order to satisfy our \\x0crst condition, we\\nrequire\\nrQt+1(wt) =rJ(wt+1) +Ht+1(wt\\x00wt+1) =rJ(wt): (3.82)\\nBy rearranging, we obtain the so-called secant equation :\\nHt+1st=yt; (3.83)\\nwherest:=wt+1\\x00wtandyt:=rJ(wt+1)\\x00rJ(wt) denote the most recent\\nstep along the optimization trajectory in parameter and gradient space,\\nrespectively.

In contrast, non-monotone line searches employ a parameter M\\x15\\n1 and ensure that the objective function decreases in every Miterations.

Consequently the trust region algorithm BT of [SZ92] is widely used in\\npractice.\\n3.3 Constrained Optimization\\nSo far our focus was on unconstrained optimization problems. Many ma-\\nchine learning problems involve constraints, and can often be written in the\\nfollowing canonical form:\\nmin\\nwJ(w) (3.101a)\\ns. t.ci(w)\\x140 fori2I (3.101b)\\nei(w) = 0 fori2E (3.101c)\\nwhere both ciandeiare convex functions. We say that wis feasible if and\\nonly if it satis\\x0ces the constraints, that is, ci(w)\\x140 fori2Iandei(w) = 0\\nfori2E.\\nRecall that wis the minimizer of an unconstrained problem if and only if\\nkrJ(w)k= 0 (see Lemma 3.6). Unfortunately, when constraints are present\\none cannot use this simple characterization of the solution. For instance, the\\nwat whichkrJ(w)k= 0 may not be a feasible point. To illustrate, consider\\nthe following simple minimization problem (see Figure 3.12):\\nmin\\nw1\\n2w2(3.102a)\\ns. t. 1\\x14w\\x142: (3.102b)\\nClearly,1\\n2w2is minimized at w= 0, but because of the presence of the con-\\nstraints, the minimum of (3.102) is attained at w= 1 whererJ(w) =wis\\nequal to 1. Therefore, we need other ways to detect convergence. In Section\\n3.3.1 we discuss some general purpose algorithms based on the concept of or-\\nthogonal projection. In Section 3.3.2 we will discuss Lagrange duality, which\\ncan be used to further characterize the solutions of constrained optimization\\nproblems.\\n3.3.1 Projection Based Methods\\nSuppose we are interested in minimizing a smooth convex function of the\\nfollowing form:\\nmin\\nw2\\nJ(w); (3.103)126 3 Optimization\\n6\\n 4\\n 2\\n 0 2 4 6\\nw02468101214 J(w)\\nFig. 3.12.

But, if we enforce the constraints 1 \\x14w\\x142 (illustrated by\\nthe shaded area) then the minimizer is attained at w= 1 (green diamond).\\nwhere \\n is a convex feasible region. For instance, \\n may be described by\\nconvex functions ciandeias in (3.101). The algorithms we describe in this\\nsection are applicable when \\n is a relatively simple set onto which we can\\ncompute an orthogonal projection.

Furthermore, as we showed\\nin Section 3.3, for constrained optimization problems krJ(w)kdoes not\\nvanish at the optimal solution. Therefore, we will use the following stopping3.3 Constrained Optimization 127\\nAlgorithm 3.7 Basic Projection Based Method\\n1:Input: Initial point w02\\n, and projected gradient norm tolerance\\n\\x0f>0\\n2:Initialize: t= 0\\n3:whilekP\\n(wt\\x00rJ(wt))\\x00wtk>\\x0fdo\\n4: Find direction of descent dt\\n5:wt+1=P\\n(wt+\\x11tdt)\\n6:t=t+ 1\\n7:end while\\n8:Return:wt\\ncriterion in our algorithms\\nkP\\n(wt\\x00rJ(wt))\\x00wtk\\x14\\x0f: (3.106)\\nThe intuition here is as follows: If wt\\x00rJ(wt)2\\n thenP\\n(wt\\x00\\nrJ(wt)) =wtif, and only if,rJ(wt) = 0, that is, wtis the global minimizer\\nofJ(w).

Finally, to obtain (3.113d) we used the fact that w\\x03is\\nfeasible and hence (3.108) holds. Since (3.113) holds with equality, one can\\nconclude that the following complementary slackness condition :\\nX\\ni2I\\x0b\\x03\\nici(w\\x03) +X\\ni2E\\x0c\\x03\\niei(w\\x03) = 0:\\nIn other words, \\x0b\\x03\\nici(w\\x03) = 0 or equivalently \\x0b\\x03\\ni= 0 whenever ci(w)<0.\\nFurthermore, since w\\x03minimizesL(w;\\x0b\\x03;\\x0c\\x03) overw, it follows that its\\ngradient must vanish at w\\x03, that is,\\nrJ(w\\x03) +X\\ni2I\\x0b\\x03\\nirci(w\\x03) +X\\ni2E\\x0c\\x03\\nirei(w\\x03) = 0:\\nPutting everything together, we obtain\\nci(w\\x03)\\x1408i2I (3.114a)\\nej(w\\x03) = 08i2E (3.114b)\\n\\x0b\\x03\\ni\\x150 (3.114c)\\n\\x0b\\x03\\nici(w\\x03) = 0 (3.114d)\\nrJ(w\\x03) +X\\ni2I\\x0b\\x03\\nirci(w\\x03) +X\\ni2E\\x0c\\x03\\nirei(w\\x03) = 0: (3.114e)\\nThe above conditions are called the KKT conditions. If the primal problem is\\nconvex, then the KKT conditions are both necessary and su\\x0ecient. In other\\nwords, if ^wand (^\\x0b;^\\x0c) satisfy (3.114) then ^ wand (^\\x0b;^\\x0c) are primal and dual\\noptimal with zero duality gap. To see this note that the \\x0crst two conditions\\nshow that ^wis feasible. Since \\x0bi\\x150,L(w;\\x0b;\\x0c ) is convex in w. Finally the\\nlast condition states that ^ wminimizesL(w;^\\x0b;^\\x0c). Since ^\\x0bici( ^w) = 0 and3.3 Constrained Optimization 131\\nej( ^w) = 0, we have\\nD(^\\x0b;^\\x0c) = min\\nwL(w;^\\x0b;^\\x0c)\\n=J( ^w) +nX\\ni=1^\\x0bici( ^w) +mX\\nj=1^\\x0cjej( ^w)\\n=J( ^w):\\n3.3.3 Linear and Quadratic Programs\\nSo far we discussed general constrained optimization problems. Many ma-\\nchine learning problems have special structure which can be exploited fur-\\nther. We discuss the implication of duality for two such problems.\\n3.3.3.1 Linear Programming\\nAn optimization problem with a linear objective function and (both equality\\nand inequality) linear constraints is said to be a linear program (LP). A\\ncanonical linear program is of the following form:\\nmin\\nwc>w (3.115a)\\ns. t.Aw=b;w\\x150: (3.115b)\\nHerewandcarendimensional vectors, while bis amdimensional vector,\\nandAis am\\x02nmatrix with m<n .\\nSuppose we are given a LP of the form:\\nmin\\nwc>w (3.116a)\\ns. t.Aw\\x15b; (3.116b)\\nwe can transform it into a canonical LP by introducing non-negative slack\\nvariables\\nmin\\nw;\\x18c>w (3.117a)\\ns. t.Aw\\x00\\x18=b;\\x18\\x150: (3.117b)\\nNext, we split winto its positive and negative parts w+andw\\x00respec-\\ntively by setting w+\\ni= max(0;wi) andw\\x00\\ni= max(0;\\x00wi).

One important\\nthing to note however is that the primal (3.115) involves nvariables and\\nn+mconstraints, while the dual (3.122) involves 2 m+nvariables and\\n4m+ 2nconstraints.\\n3.3.3.2 Quadratic Programming\\nAn optimization problem with a convex quadratic objective function and lin-\\near constraints is said to be a convex quadratic program (QP).

IfAhas full row rank, and the\\nreduced-Hessian matrix Z>GZis positive de\\x0cnite, then there exists a unique\\npair(w\\x03;\\x0c\\x03)which solves (3.126) . Furthermore, w\\x03also minimizes (3.124) .\\nProof Note that a unique ( w\\x03;\\x0c\\x03) exists whenever the KKT matrix is\\nnon-singular. Suppose this is not the case, then there exist non-zero vectors\\naandbsuch that\\n\\x14G A>\\nA 0\\x15\\x14a\\nb\\x15\\n= 0:\\nSinceAa= 0 this implies that alies in the null space of Aand hence there\\nexists ausuch thata=Zu.

On the\\nother hand, the full row rank of AandA>b= 0 implies that b= 0. In\\nsummary, both aandbare zero, a contradiction.\\nLetw6=w\\x03be any other feasible point and \\x01 w=w\\x03\\x00w. SinceAw\\x03=\\nAw=bwe have that A\\x01w= 0. Hence, there exists a non-zero usuch that\\n\\x01w=Zu. The objective function J(w) can be written as\\nJ(w) =1\\n2(w\\x03\\x00\\x01w)>G(w\\x03\\x00\\x01w) + (w\\x03\\x00\\x01w)>d\\n=J(w\\x03) +1\\n2\\x01w>G\\x01w\\x00(Gw\\x03+d)>\\x01w:\\nFirst note that1\\n2\\x01w>G\\x01w=1\\n2u>Z>GZu > 0 by positive de\\x0cniteness of\\nthe reduced Hessian. Second, since w\\x03solves (3.126) it follows that ( Gw\\x03+3.4 Stochastic Optimization 135\\nd)>\\x01w=\\x0c>A\\x01w= 0. Together these two observations imply that J(w)>\\nJ(w\\x03).\\nIf the technical conditions of the above theorem are met, then solving the\\nequality constrained QP (3.124) is equivalent to solving the linear system\\n(3.126). See [NW99] for a extensive discussion of algorithms that can be\\nused for this task.\\nNext we turn our attention to the general QP (3.123) which also contains\\ninequality constraints. The Lagrangian in this case can be written as\\nL(w;\\x0c) =1\\n2w>Gw+w>d+X\\ni2I\\x0bi(a>\\niw\\x00bi) +X\\ni2E\\x0ci(a>\\niw\\x00bi):(3.127)\\nLetw\\x03denote the minimizer of (3.123). If we de\\x0cne the active set A(w\\x03) as\\nA(w\\x03) =n\\nis.t.i2Ianda>\\niw\\x03=bio\\n;\\nthen the KKT conditions (3.114) for this problem can be written as\\na>\\niw\\x00bi<08i2InA(w\\x03) (3.128a)\\na>\\niw\\x00bi= 08i2E[A(w\\x03) (3.128b)\\n\\x0b\\x03\\ni\\x1508i2A(w\\x03) (3.128c)\\nGw\\x03+d+X\\ni2A(w\\x03)\\x0b\\x03\\niai+X\\ni2E\\x0ciai= 0: (3.128d)\\nConceptually the main di\\x0eculty in solving (3.123) is in identifying the active\\nsetA(w\\x03). This is because \\x0b\\x03\\ni= 0 for all i2InA(w\\x03). Most algorithms\\nfor solving (3.123) can be viewed as di\\x0berent ways to identify the active set.\\nSee [NW99] for a detailed discussion.\\n3.4 Stochastic Optimization\\nRecall that regularized risk minimization involves a data-driven optimization\\nproblem in which the objective function involves the summation of loss terms\\nover a set of data to be modeled:\\nmin\\nfJ(f) :=\\x15\\n(f) +1\\nmmX\\ni=1l(f(xi);yi):\\nClassical optimization techniques must compute this sum in its entirety for\\neach evaluation of the objective, respectively its gradient. As available data\\nsets grow ever larger, such \\\\batch\" optimizers therefore become increasingly\\nine\\x0ecient. They are also ill-suited for the incremental setting, where partial\\ndata must be modeled as it arrives.136 3 Optimization\\nStochastic gradient-based methods, by contrast, work with gradient esti-\\nmates obtained from small subsamples (mini-batches) of training data. This\\ncan greatly reduce computational requirements: on large, redundant data\\nsets, simple stochastic gradient descent routinely outperforms sophisticated\\nsecond-order batch methods by orders of magnitude.\\nThe key idea here is that J(w) is replaced by an instantaneous estimate\\nJtwhich is computed from a mini-batch of size kcomprising of a subset of\\npoints (xt\\ni;yt\\ni) withi= 1;:::;k drawn from the dataset:\\nJt(w) =\\x15\\n(w) +1\\nkkX\\ni=1l(w;xt\\ni;yt\\ni): (3.129)\\nSettingk= 1 obtains an algorithm which processes data points as they\\narrive.\\n3.4.1 Stochastic Gradient Descent\\nPerhaps the simplest stochastic optimization algorithm is Stochastic Gradi-\\nent Descent (SGD). The parameter update of SGD takes the form:\\nwt+1=wt\\x00\\x11trJt(wt): (3.130)\\nIfJtis not di\\x0berentiable, then one can choose an arbitrary subgradient from\\n@Jt(wt) to compute the update. It has been shown that SGD asymptotically\\nconverges to the true minimizer of J(w) if the stepsize \\x11tdecays asO(1=p\\nt).\\nFor instance, one could set\\n\\x11t=r\\x1c\\n\\x1c+t; (3.131)\\nwhere\\x1c >0 is a tuning parameter. See Algorithm 3.8 for details.\\n3.4.1.1 Practical Considerations\\nOne simple yet e\\x0bective rule of thumb to tune \\x1cis to select a small subset\\nof data, try various values of \\x1con this subset, and choose the \\x1cthat most\\nreduces the objective function.\\nIn some cases letting \\x11tto decay as O(1=t) has been found to be more\\ne\\x0bective:\\n\\x11t=\\x1c\\n\\x1c+t: (3.132)\\nThe free parameter \\x1c > 0 can be tuned as described above.

Some simple rules of thumb can\\nalleviate this anxiety\\nCode Reuse: Implementing an e\\x0ecient optimization algorithm correctly\\nis both time consuming and error prone. Therefore, as far as possible use\\nexisting libraries. A number of high class optimization libraries both com-\\nmercial and open source exist.\\nUnconstrained Problems: For unconstrained minimization of a smooth\\nconvex function LBFGS (Section 3.2.6.1 is the algorithm of choice. In many\\npractical situations the spectral gradient method (Section 3.2.6.2) is also\\nvery competitive. It also has the added advantage of being easy to imple-\\nment. If the function to be minimized is non-smooth then Bundle methods\\n(Section 3.2.7) are to be preferred. Amongst the di\\x0berent formulations, the\\nBundle Trust algorithm tends to be quite robust.\\nConstrained Problems: For constrained problems it is very important\\nto understand the nature of the constraints. Simple equality ( Ax=b) and\\nbox (l\\x14x\\x14u) constraints are easier to handle than general non-linear\\nconstraints. If the objective function is smooth, the constraint set \\n is simple,\\nand orthogonal projections P\\nare easy to compute, then spectral projected\\ngradient (Section 3.3.1) is the method of choice. If the optimization problem\\nis a QP or an LP then specialized solvers tend to be much faster than general\\npurpose solvers.140 3 Optimization\\nLarge Scale Problems: If your parameter vector is high dimensional then\\nconsider coordinate descent (Section 3.2.2) especially if the one dimensional\\nline search along a coordinate can be carried out e\\x0eciently.

In many modern applications data is available only in a streaming\\nfashion, and one needs to predict labels on the \\ry. To describe a concrete\\nexample, consider the task of spam \\x0cltering. As emails arrive the learning\\nalgorithm needs to classify them as spam or ham. Tasks such as these are\\ntackled via online learning. Online learning proceeds in rounds. At each\\nround a training example is revealed to the learning algorithm, which uses\\nits current model to predict the label. The true label is then revealed to\\nthe learner which incurs a loss and updates its model based on the feedback\\nprovided. This protocol is summarized in Algorithm 4.1. The goal of online\\nlearning is to minimize the total loss incurred. By an appropriate choice\\nof labels and loss functions, this setting encompasses a large number of\\ntasks such as classi\\x0ccation, regression, and density estimation. In our spam\\ndetection example, if an email is misclassi\\x0ced the user can provide feedback\\nwhich is used to update the spam \\x0clter, and the goal is to minimize the\\nnumber of misclassi\\x0ced emails.\\n4.1 Halving Algorithm\\nThe halving algorithm is conceptually simple, yet it illustrates many of the\\nconcepts in online learning. Suppose we have access to a set of nexperts,\\nthat is, functions fiwhich map from the input space Xto the output space\\nY=f\\x061g. Furthermore, assume that one of the experts is consistent, that\\nis, there exists a j2f1;:::;ngsuch thatfj(xt) =ytfort= 1;:::;T . The\\nhalving algorithm maintains a set Ctof consistent experts at time t. Initially\\nC0=f1;:::;ng, and it is updated recursively as\\nCt+1=fi2Cts.t.fi(xt+1) =yt+1g: (4.1)\\nThe prediction on a new data point is computed via a majority vote amongst\\nthe consistent experts: ^ yt= majority( Ct).\\nLemma 4.1 The Halving algorithm makes at most log2(n)mistakes.\\n143144 4 Online Learning and Boosting\\nAlgorithm 4.1 Protocol of Online Learning\\n1:fort= 1;:::;T dodo\\n2: Get training instance xt\\n3: Predict label ^ yt\\n4: Get true label yt\\n5: Incur lossl(^yt;xt;yt)\\n6: Update model\\n7:end for\\nProof LetMdenote the total number of mistakes.

Solving for Mcompletes the proof.\\n4.2 Weighted Majority\\nWe now turn to the scenario where none of the experts is consistent. There-\\nfore, the aim here is not to minimize the number mistakes but to minimize\\nregret.\\nIn this chapter we will consider online methods for solving the following\\noptimization problem:\\nmin\\nw2\\nJ(w) whereJ(w) =TX\\nt=1ft(w): (4.2)\\nSuppose we have access to a function  which is continuously di\\x0berentiable\\nand strongly convex with modulus of strong convexity \\x1b > 0 (see Section\\n3.1.4 for de\\x0cnition of strong convexity), then we can de\\x0cne the Bregman\\ndivergence (3.29) corresponding to  as\\n\\x01 (w;w0) = (w)\\x00 (w0)\\x00\\nw\\x00w0;r (w0)\\x0b\\n:\\nWe can also generalize the orthogonal projection (3.104) by replacing the\\nsquare Euclidean norm with the above Bregman divergence:\\nP ;\\n(w0) = argmin\\nw2\\n\\x01 (w;w0): (4.3)4.2 Weighted Majority 145\\nAlgorithm 4.2 Stochastic (sub)gradient Descent\\n1:Input: Initial point x1, maximum iterations T\\n2:fort= 1;:::;T do\\n3: Compute ^wt+1=r \\x03(r (wt)\\x00\\x11tgt) withgt=@wft(wt)\\n4: Setwt+1=P ;\\n( ^wt+1)\\n5:end for\\n6:Return:wT+1\\nDenotew\\x03=P ;\\n(w0).

Before\\nanalyzing the performance of the algorithm we would like to discuss three\\nspecial cases.

Using Bayes rule (1.15) one can write the likelihood\\np(\\x12jX;Y )/p(\\x12)p(YjX;\\x12) =p(\\x12)mY\\ni=1p(yijxi;\\x12); (5.1)\\nand hence the negative log-likelihood\\n\\x00logp(\\x12jX;Y ) =\\x00mX\\ni=1logp(yijxi;\\x12)\\x00logp(\\x12) + const.

For instance, to classify the\\npoints in Figure BUGBUG, we need a nonlinear decision boundary, but\\nonce we map the points to a 3 dimensional space a hyperplane su\\x0eces.\\nSecond, kernels allow us to construct machine learning algorithms in the\\ndot product space Hwithout explicitly computing \\x08( x). Third, we need not\\nmake any assumptions about the input space Xother than for it to be a\\nset. As we will see later in this chapter, this allows us to compute similarity\\nbetween discrete objects such as strings, trees, and graphs. In the \\x0crst half\\nof this chapter we will present some examples of kernels, and discuss some\\ntheoretical properties of kernels in the second half.\\n155156 6 Kernels and Function Spaces\\n6.1.1 Examples\\n6.1.1.1 Linear Kernel\\nLinear kernels are perhaps the simplest of all kernels. We assume that x2Rn\\nand de\\x0cne\\nk(x;x0) =\\nx;x0\\x0b\\n=X\\nixix0\\ni:\\nIfxandx0are dense then computing the kernel takes O(n) time. On the\\nother hand, for sparse vectors this can be reduced to O(jnnz(x)\\\\nnz(x0)j),\\nwherennz(\\x01) denotes the set of non-zero indices of a vector and j\\x01jde-\\nnotes the size of a set. Linear kernels are a natural representation to use for\\nvectorial data. They are also widely used in text mining where documents\\nare represented by a vector containing the frequency of occurrence of words\\n(Recall that we encountered this so-called bag of words representation in\\nChapter 1). Instead of a simple bag of words, one can also map a text to the\\nset of pairs of words that co-occur in a sentence for a richer representation.\\n6.1.1.2 Polynomial Kernel\\nGivenx2Rn, we can compute a feature map \\x08 by taking all the d-th\\norder products (also called the monomials) of the entries of x. To illustrate\\nwith a concrete example, let us consider x= (x1;x2) andd= 2, in which\\ncase \\x08(x) =\\x00\\nx2\\n1;x2\\n2;x1x2;x2x1\\x01\\n. Although it is tedious to compute \\x08( x)\\nand \\x08(x0) explicitly in order to compute k(x;x), there is a shortcut as the\\nfollowing proposition shows.\\nProposition 6.1 Let\\x08(x)(resp. \\x08(x0)) denote the vector whose entries\\nare all possible d-th degree ordered products of the entries of x(resp.x0).\\nThen\\nk(x;x0) =\\n\\x08(x);\\x08(x0)\\x0b\\n=\\x00\\nx;x0\\x0b\\x01d: (6.2)\\nProof By direct computation\\n\\n\\x08(x);\\x08(x0)\\x0b\\n=X\\nj1:::X\\njdxj1:::xjd\\x01x0\\nj1:::x0\\njd\\n=X\\nj1xj1\\x01x0\\nj1:::X\\njdxjd\\x01x0\\njd=0\\n@X\\njxj\\x01x0\\nj1\\nAd\\n=\\x00\\nx;x0\\x0b\\x01d6.1 The Basics 157\\nThe kernel (6.2) is called the polynomial kernel. An useful extension is the\\ninhomogeneous polynomial kernel\\nk(x;x0) =\\x00\\nx;x0\\x0b\\n+c\\x01d; (6.3)\\nwhich computes all monomials up to degree d(problem 6.2).\\n6.1.1.3 Radial Basis Function Kernels\\n6.1.1.4 Convolution Kernels\\nThe framework of convolution kernels is a general way to extend the notion\\nof kernels to structured objects such as strings, trees, and graphs. Let x2X\\nbe a discrete object which can be decomposed into Ppartsxp2Xpin many\\ndi\\x0berent ways. As a concrete example consider the string x=abcwhich can\\nbe split into two sets of substrings of size two namely fa;bcgandfab;cg.\\nWe denote the set of all such decompositions as R(x), and use it to build a\\nkernel on Xas follows:\\n[k1?:::?kP] (x;x0) =X\\n\\x16x2R(x);\\x16x02R(x0)PY\\np=1kp(\\x16xp;\\x16x0\\np): (6.4)\\nHere, the sum is over all possible ways in which we can decompose xand\\nx0into \\x16x1;:::; \\x16xPand \\x16x0\\n1;:::; \\x16x0\\nPrespectively. If the cardinality of R(x) is\\n\\x0cnite, then it can be shown that (6.4) results in a valid kernel. Although\\nconvolution kernels provide the abstract framework, speci\\x0cc instantiations\\nof this idea lead to a rich set of kernels on discrete objects. We will now\\ndiscuss some of them in detail.\\n6.1.1.5 String Kernels\\nThe basic idea behind string kernels is simple: Compare the strings by\\nmeans of the subsequences they contain. More the number of common sub-\\nsequences, the more similar two strings are. The subsequences need not have\\nequal weights. For instance, the weight of a subsequence may be given by the\\ninverse frequency of its occurrence. Similarly, if the \\x0crst and last characters\\nof a subsequence are rather far apart, then its contribution to the kernel\\nmust be down-weighted.\\nFormally, a string xis composed of characters from a \\x0cnite alphabet \\x06\\nandjxjdenotes its length. We say that sis a subsequence of x=x1x2:::xjxj\\nifs=xi1xi2:::xijsjfor some 1\\x14i1<i2<:::<ijsj\\x14jxj. In particular, if\\nii+1=ii+1 thensis a substring of x. For example, acbis not a subsequence\\nofadbc whileabcis a subsequence and adcis a substring. Assume that there\\nexists a function #( x;s) which returns the number of times a subsequence158 6 Kernels and Function Spaces\\nsoccurs inxand a non-negative weighting function w(s)\\x150 which returns\\nthe weight associated with s. Then the basic string kernel can be written as\\nk(x;x0) =X\\ns#(x;s) #(x0;s)w(s): (6.5)\\nDi\\x0berent string kernels are derived by specializing the above equation:\\nAll substrings kernel: If we restrict the summation in (6.5) to sub-\\nstrings then [VS04] provide a su\\x0ex tree based algorithm which allows one\\nto compute for arbitrary w(s) the kernel k(x;x0) inO(jxj+jx0j) time and\\nmemory.\\nk-Spectrum kernel: Thek-spectrum kernel is obtained by restricting\\nthe summation in (6.5) to substrings of length k. A slightly general variant\\nconsiders all substrings of length up to k. Herekis a tuning parameter\\nwhich is typically set to be a small number ( e.g., 5). A simple trie based\\nalgorithm can be used to compute the k-spectrum kernel in O((jxj+jx0j)k)\\ntime (problem 6.3).\\nInexact substring kernel: Sometimes the input strings might have\\nmeasurement errors and therefore it is desirable to take into account inexact\\nmatches. This is done by replacing #( x;s) in (6.5) by another function\\n#(x;s;\\x0f ) which reports the number of approximate matches of sinx. Here\\n\\x0fdenotes the number of mismatches allowed, typically a small number ( e.g.,\\n3). By trading o\\x0b computational complexity with storage the kernel can be\\ncomputed e\\x0eciently. See [LK03] for details.\\nMismatch kernel: Instead of simply counting the number of occurrences\\nof a substring if we use a weighting scheme which down-weights the contribu-\\ntions of longer subsequences then this yields the so-called mismatch kernel.\\nGiven an index sequence I= (i1;:::;ik) with 1\\x14i1< i2< ::: < i k\\x14jxj\\nwe can associate the subsequence x(I) =xi1xi2:::xikwithI. Furthermore,\\nde\\x0cnejIj=ik\\x00i1+ 1. Clearly,jIj>kifIis not contiguous. Let \\x15\\x141 be\\na decay factor. Rede\\x0cne\\n#(x;s) =X\\ns=x(I)\\x15jIj; (6.6)\\nthat is, we count all occurrences of sinxbut now the weight associated with\\na subsequence depends on its length. To illustrate, consider the subsequence\\nabcwhich occurs in the string abcebc twice, namely, abcebcandabcebc . The\\n\\x0crst occurrence is counted with weight \\x153while the second occurrence is\\ncounted with the weight \\x156. As it turns out, this kernel can be computed\\nby a dynamic programming algorithm (problem BUGBUG) in O(jxj\\x01jx0j)\\ntime.6.1 The Basics 159\\n6.1.1.6 Graph Kernels\\nThere are two di\\x0berent notions of graph kernels. First, kernels ongraphs\\nare used to compare nodes of a single graph. In contrast, kernels between\\ngraphs focus on comparing two graphs. A random walk (or its continuous\\ntime limit, di\\x0busion) underlie both types of kernels. The basic intuition is\\nthat two nodes are similar if there are a number of paths which connect\\nthem while two graphs are similar if they share many common paths. To\\ndescribe these kernels formally we need to introduce some notation.\\nA graphGconsists of an ordered set of nverticesV=fv1;v2;:::;vng,\\nand a set of directed edges E\\x1aV\\x02V. A vertexviis said to be a neighbor\\nof another vertex vjif they are connected by an edge, i.e., if (vi;vj)2E;\\nthis is also denoted vi\\x18vj. The adjacency matrix of a graph is the n\\x02n\\nmatrixAwithAij= 1 ifvi\\x18vj, and 0 otherwise. A walk of length konG\\nis a sequence of indices i0;i1;:::iksuch thatvir\\x001\\x18virfor all 1\\x14r\\x14k.\\nThe adjacency matrix has a normalized cousin, de\\x0cned ~A:=D\\x001A, which\\nhas the property that each of its rows sums to one, and it can therefore\\nserve as the transition matrix for a stochastic process. Here, Dis a diag-\\nonal matrix of node degrees, i.e.,Dii=di=P\\njAij. A random walk on\\nGis a process generating sequences of vertices vi1;vi2;vi3;:::according to\\nP(ik+1ji1;:::ik) =~Aik;ik+1. Thetthpower of ~Athus describes t-length walks,\\ni.e.,(~At)ijis the probability of a transition from vertex vjto vertexvivia\\na walk of length t(problem BUGBUG). If p0is an initial probability dis-\\ntribution over vertices, then the probability distribution ptdescribing the\\nlocation of our random walker at time tispt=~Atp0. Thejthcomponent of\\nptdenotes the probability of \\x0cnishing a t-length walk at vertex vj. A random\\nwalk need not continue inde\\x0cnitely; to model this, we associate every node\\nvikin the graph with a stopping probability qik. The overall probability of\\nstopping after tsteps is given by q>pt.\\nGiven two graphs G(V;E) andG0(V0;E0), their direct product G\\x02is a\\ngraph with vertex set\\nV\\x02=f(vi;v0\\nr) :vi2V; v0\\nr2V0g; (6.7)\\nand edge set\\nE\\x02=f((vi;v0\\nr);(vj;v0\\ns)) : (vi;vj)2E^(v0\\nr;v0\\ns)2E0g: (6.8)\\nIn other words, G\\x02is a graph over pairs of vertices from GandG0, and\\ntwo vertices in G\\x02are neighbors if and only if the corresponding vertices\\ninGandG0are both neighbors; see Figure 6.1 for an illustration. If Aand\\nA0are the respective adjacency matrices of GandG0, then the adjacency160 6 Kernels and Function Spaces\\nG112\\n3\\nG21\\' 2\\'\\n3\\' 4\\'\\nG\\x0211\\' 21\\' 31\\'\\n34\\' 12\\'\\n24\\' 22\\'\\n14\\' 32\\'\\n33\\' 23\\' 13\\'\\nFig. 6.1. Two graphs ( G1&G2) and their direct product ( G\\x02). Each node of the\\ndirect product graph is labeled with a pair of nodes (6.7); an edge exists in the\\ndirect product if and only if the corresponding nodes are adjacent in both original\\ngraphs (6.8). For instance, nodes 110and 320are adjacent because there is an edge\\nbetween nodes 1 and 3 in the \\x0crst, and 10and 20in the second graph.\\nmatrix ofG\\x02isA\\x02=A\\nA0. Similarly, ~A\\x02=~A\\n~A0. Performing a random\\nwalk on the direct product graph is equivalent to performing a simultaneous\\nrandom walk on GandG0. Ifpandp0denote initial probability distributions\\nover the vertices of GandG0, then the corresponding initial probability\\ndistribution on the direct product graph is p\\x02:=p\\np0. Likewise, if qand\\nq0are stopping probabilities (that is, the probability that a random walk\\nends at a given vertex), then the stopping probability on the direct product\\ngraph isq\\x02:=q\\nq0.\\nTo de\\x0cne a kernel which computes the similarity between GandG0, one\\nnatural idea is to simply sum up q>\\n\\x02~At\\n\\x02p\\x02for all values of t. However, this\\nsum might not converge, leaving the kernel value unde\\x0cned. To overcome\\nthis problem, we introduce appropriately chosen non-negative coe\\x0ecients\\n\\x16(t), and de\\x0cne the kernel between GandG0as\\nk(G;G0) :=1X\\nt=0\\x16(t)q>\\n\\x02~At\\n\\x02p\\x02: (6.9)\\nThis idea can be extended to graphs whose nodes are associated with labels\\nby replacing the matrix ~A\\x02with a matrix of label similarities. For appro-\\npriate choices of \\x16(t) the above sum converges and e\\x0ecient algorithms for\\ncomputing the kernel can be devised. See [ ?] for details.\\nAs it turns out, the simple idea of performing a random walk on the prod-6.2 Kernels 161\\nuct graph can be extended to compute kernels on Auto Regressive Moving\\nAverage (ARMA) models [VSV07]. Similarly, it can also be used to de\\x0cne\\nkernels between transducers. Connections between the so-called rational ker-\\nnels on transducers and the graph kernels de\\x0cned via (6.9) are made explicit\\nin [?].\\n6.2 Kernels\\n6.2.1 Feature Maps\\ngive examples, linear classi\\x0cer, nonlinear ones with r2-r3 map\\n6.2.2 The Kernel Trick\\n6.2.3 Examples of Kernels\\ngaussian, polynomial, linear, texts, graphs\\n- stress the fact that there is a di\\x0berence between structure in the input\\nspace and structure in the output space\\n6.3 Algorithms\\n6.3.1 Kernel Perceptron\\n6.3.2 Trivial Classi\\x0cer\\n6.3.3 Kernel Principal Component Analysis\\n6.4 Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces\\nAs it turns out, this class of functions coincides with the class of positive\\nsemi-de\\x0cnite functions.

In this case,\\nHij=yiyjh\\x1e(xi);\\x1e(xj)i=yiyjk(xi;xj), wherekis the kernel associated\\nwith the RKHS. Given the optimal \\x0b, one can easily recover the decision\\nboundary. This is a direct consequence of (7.6a), which allows us to write w\\nas a linear combination of the training data:\\nw=mX\\ni=1\\x0biyi\\x1e(xi);\\nand hence the decision boundary as\\nhw;xi+b=mX\\ni=1\\x0biyik(xi;x) +b: (7.10)\\nBy the KKT conditions (Section 3.3) we have\\n\\x0bi(1\\x00\\x18i\\x00yi(hw;xii+b)) = 0 and \\x0ci\\x18i= 0:\\nWe now consider three cases for yi(hw;xii+b) and the implications of the\\nKKT conditions (see Figure 7.2).7.1 Support Vector Classi\\x0ccation 169\\nfxjhw;xi+b=\\x001gfxjhw;xi+b= 1g\\nFig. 7.2.

However, in practice to\\nrecoverbwe average\\nb=yi\\x00X\\nihw;xii: (7.11)\\nover all support vectors, that is, points xifor which 0 < \\x0bi<C\\nm. Because\\nit uses support vectors, the overall algorithm is called C-Support Vector\\nclassi\\x0cer or C-SV classi\\x0cer for short.170 7 Linear Models\\n7.1.1 A Regularized Risk Minimization Viewpoint\\nA closer examination of (7.5) reveals that \\x18i= 0 whenever yi(hw;xii+b)>1.\\nOn the other hand, \\x18i= 1\\x00yi(hw;xii+b) whenever yi(hw;xii+b)<\\n1. In short, \\x18i= max(0;1\\x00yi(hw;xii+b)). Using this observation one\\ncan eliminate \\x18ifrom (7.5), and write it as the following unconstrained\\noptimization problem:\\nmin\\nw;b1\\n2kwk2+C\\nmmX\\ni=1max(0;1\\x00yi(hw;xii+b)): (7.12)\\nWriting (7.5) as (7.12) is particularly revealing because it shows that a\\nsupport vector classi\\x0cer is nothing but a regularized risk minimizer. Here\\nthe regularizer is the square norm of the decision hyperplane1\\n2kwk2, and\\nthe loss function is the so-called binary hinge loss (Figure 7.3):\\nl(w;x;y ) = max(0;1\\x00y(hw;xi+b)): (7.13)\\nIt is easy to verify that the binary hinge loss (7.13) is convex but non-\\ndi\\x0berentiable (see Figure 7.3) which renders the overall objective function\\n(7.12) to be convex but non-smooth. There are two di\\x0berent strategies to\\nminimize such an objective function. If minimizing (7.12) in the primal, one\\ncan employ non-smooth convex optimizers such as bundle methods (Section\\n3.2.7). This yields a ddimensional problem where dis the dimension of x.\\nOn the other hand, since (7.12) is strongly convex because of the presence\\nof the1\\n2kwk2term, its Fenchel dual has a Lipschitz continuous gradient\\n(see Lemma 3.10). The dual problem is mdimensional and contains linear\\nconstraints. This strategy is particularly attractive when the kernel trick is\\nused or whenever d\\x1dm. In fact, the dual problem obtained via Fenchel\\nduality is very related to the Quadratic programming problem (7.9) obtained\\nvia Lagrange duality (problem 7.4).\\n7.1.2 An Exponential Family Interpretation\\nOur motivating arguments for deriving the SVM algorithm have largely\\nbeen geometric. We now show that an equally elegant probabilistic interpre-\\ntation also exists. Assuming that the training set f(x1;y1);:::; (xm;ym)g\\nwas drawn iid from some underlying distribution, and using the Bayes rule\\n(1.15) one can write the likelihood\\np(\\x12jX;Y )/p(\\x12)p(YjX;\\x12) =p(\\x12)mY\\ni=1p(yijxi;\\x12); (7.14)7.1 Support Vector Classi\\x0ccation 171\\ny(hw;xi+b)loss\\nFig. 7.3.

Given the optimal \\x12, we can predict the class label\\nat any given xvia\\ny\\x03= argmax\\nyp(yjx;\\x12): (7.17)\\nOf course, our aim is not just to maximize p(yijxi;\\x12) but also to ensure\\nthatp(yjxi;\\x12) is small for all y6=yi.

The quantity logp(yijxi;\\x12)\\nmaxy6=yip(yjxi;\\x12)is sometimes\\ncalled the log-odds ratio , and the above discussion shows that SVMs can\\nbe interpreted as maximizing the log-odds ratio in the exponential family.\\nThis interpretation will be developed further when we consider extensions of\\nSVMs to tackle multiclass, multilabel, and structured prediction problems.\\n7.1.3 Specialized Algorithms for Training SVMs\\nThe main task in training SVMs boils down to solving (7.9). The m\\x02m\\nmatrixHis usually dense and cannot be stored in memory. Decomposition\\nmethods are designed to overcome these di\\x0eculties.

Di\\x0berent losses have di\\x0berent properties and hence\\nlead to di\\x0berent estimators. For instance, the square loss leads to penalized\\nleast squares (LS) regression, while the Laplace loss leads to the penalized\\nleast absolute deviations (LAD) estimator. Huber\\'s loss on the other hand is\\na combination of the penalized LS and LAD estimators, and the pinball loss\\nwith parameter \\x1c2[0;1] is used to estimate \\x1c-quantiles. Setting \\x1c= 0:5\\nin the pinball loss leads to a scaled version of the Laplace loss.

Towards this end choose \\x11\\nsuch that log \\x11= 1 and rewrite (7.20):\\nlogp(yjx;w)\\nmaxy06=yp(y0jx;w)=\\x1c\\n\\x1e(x;y)\\x00max\\ny06=y\\x1e(x;y0);w\\x1d\\n\\x151:\\nRearranging yields (7.76).\\n7.6.2 Multilabel Classi\\x0ccation\\nIn multilabel classi\\x0ccation one or more of kpossible labels are assigned to\\na training example. Just like in the multiclass case two di\\x0berent losses can\\nbe de\\x0cned.\\n7.6.2.1 Additive Multilabel Hinge Loss\\nIf we let Yx\\x12Ydenote the labels assigned to x, and generalize the hinge\\nloss to penalize all labels y0=2Yxwhich have been assigned higher score than\\nsomey2Yx, then the loss can be written as\\nl(w;x;y ) =X\\ny2Yxandy0=2Yxmax\\x00\\n0;1\\x00(\\n\\x1e(x;y)\\x00\\x1e(x;y0);w\\x0b\\n)\\x01\\n:(7.77)\\n7.6.2.2 Maximum Multilabel Hinge Loss\\nAnother variant only penalizes the maximum violating pair. In this case the\\nloss can be written as\\nl(w;x;y ) = max\\x12\\n0;max\\ny2Yx;y0=2Yx\\x02\\n1\\x00\\x00\\n\\x1e(x;y)\\x00\\x1e(x;y0);w\\x0b\\x01\\x03\\x13\\n:(7.78)\\nOne can immediately verify that specializing the above losses to the mul-\\nticlass case recovers (7.74) and (7.75) respectively, while the binary case\\nrecovers (7.13). The above losses are zero only when\\nmin\\ny2Yxf(x;y) = min\\ny2Yxh\\x1e(x;y);wi\\x151 + max\\ny0=2Yx\\n\\x1e(x;y0);w\\x0b\\n= 1 + max\\ny0=2Yxf(x;y0):\\nThis can be interpreted as follows: The losses ensure that all the labels\\nassigned to xhave larger scores compared to labels not assigned to xwith\\nthe margin of separation of at least 1.\\nAlthough the above loss functions are compatible with multiple labels,\\nthe prediction function argmaxyf(x;y) only takes into account the label\\nwith the highest score. This is a signi\\x0ccant drawback of such models, which\\ncan be overcome by using a multiclass approach instead. Let jYjbe the\\nsize of the label set and z2RjYjdenote a vector with \\x061 entries. We set192 7 Linear Models\\nzy= +1 if the y2Yxandzy=\\x001 otherwise, and use the multiclass loss\\n(7.75) onz. To predict we compute z\\x03= argmaxzf(x;z) and assign to x\\nthe labels corresponding to components of z\\x03which are +1. Since zcan\\ntake on 2jYjpossible values, this approach is not feasible if jYjis large. To\\ntackle such problems, and to further reduce the computational complexity\\nwe assume that the labels correlations are captured via a jYj\\x02jYjpositive\\nsemi-de\\x0cnite matrix P, and\\x1e(x;y) can be written as \\x1e(x)\\nPy. Here\\ndenotes the Kronecker product. Furthermore, we express the vector was\\nan\\x02jYjmatrixW, wherendenotes the dimension of \\x1e(x). With these\\nassumptionsh\\x1e(x)\\nP(z\\x00z0);wican be rewritten as\\nD\\n\\x1e(x)>WP; (z\\x00z0)E\\n=X\\nih\\n\\x1e(x)>WPi\\ni(zi\\x00z0\\ni);\\nand (7.78) specializes to\\nl(w;x;z ) := max \\n0; \\n1\\x00X\\nimin\\nz0\\ni6=zih\\n\\x1e(x)>WPi\\ni(zi\\x00z0\\ni)!!\\n:(7.79)\\nA analogous specialization of (7.77) can also be derived wherein the mini-\\nmum is replaced by a summation. Since the minimum (or summation as the\\ncase may be) is over jYjpossible labels, computing the loss is tractable even\\nif the set of labels Yis large.\\n7.6.3 Ordinal Regression and Ranking\\nWe can generalize our above discussion to consider slightly more general\\nranking problems. Denote by Ythe set of all directed acyclic graphs on N\\nnodes. The presence of an edge ( i;j) iny2Yindicates that iis preferred\\ntoj. The goal is to \\x0cnd a function f(x;i) which imposes a total order on\\nf1;:::;Ngwhich is in close agreement with y. Speci\\x0ccally, if the estimation\\nerror is given by the number of subgraphs of ywhich are in disagreement\\nwith the total order imposed by f, then the additive version of the loss can\\nbe written as\\nl(w;x;y ) =X\\nG2A(y)max\\n(i;j)2G(0;1\\x00(f(x;i)\\x00f(x;j))); (7.80)\\nwhere A(y) denotes the set of all possible subgraphs of y. The maximum\\nmargin version, on the other hand, is given by\\nl(w;x;y ) = max\\nG2A(y)max\\n(i;j)2G(0;1\\x00(f(x;i)\\x00f(x;j))): (7.81)7.7 Large Margin Classi\\x0cers with Structure 193\\nIn other words, we test for each subgraph Gofyif the ranking imposed by G\\nis satis\\x0ced by f.

This often blurs the similarities as well as subtle di\\x0berences\\nbetween them, often for historic reasons: Each new loss is typically accompa-\\nnied by at least one publication dedicated to it. In many cases, the loss is not\\nspelled out explicitly either but instead, it is only given by means of a con-\\nstrained optimization problem. A case in point are the papers introducing\\n(binary) hinge loss [BM92, CV95] and structured loss [TGK04, TJHA05].\\nLikewise, a geometric description obscures the underlying loss function, as\\nin novelty detection [SPST+01].\\nIn this section we give an expository yet unifying presentation of many\\nof those loss functions. Many of them are well known, while others, such\\nas multivariate ranking, hazard regression, or Poisson regression are not\\ncommonly used in machine learning. Tables A3.1 and A3.1 contain a choice\\nsubset of simple scalar and vectorial losses. Our aim is to put the multitude\\nof loss functions in an uni\\x0ced framework, and to show how these losses\\nand their (sub)gradients can be computed e\\x0eciently for use in our solver\\nframework.\\nNote that not all losses, while convex, are continuously di\\x0berentiable.

The latter is a convex function in\\nwandx.

In all cases,\\nhw;xiwill play a key role insofar as the loss is convex in terms of the scalar\\nquantityhw;xi. A large number of loss functions fall into this category,\\nas described in Table A3.1.

For all scalar losses we\\nmay writel(x;y;w ) =\\x16l(hw;xi;y), as described in Table A3.1.

At its core it relies on two\\ntypes of convex loss functions: logistic loss:\\nl(x;y;w ) = logX\\ny02Yexp\\x00\\nw;\\x1e(x;y0)\\x0b\\x01\\n\\x00hw;\\x1e(x;y)i; (3.5)\\nand soft-margin loss:\\nl(x;y;w ) = max\\ny02Y\\x00(y;y0)\\nw;\\x1e(x;y0)\\x00\\x1e(x;y)\\x0b\\n+ \\x01(y;y0): (3.6)\\nHere\\x1e(x;y) is a joint feature map, \\x01( y;y0)\\x150 describes the cost of mis-\\nclassifyingybyy0, and \\x00(y;y0)\\x150 is a scaling term which indicates by how\\nmuch the large margin property should be enforced. For instance, [TGK04]\\nchoose \\x00(y;y0) = 1. On the other hand [TJHA05] suggest \\x00( y;y0) = \\x01(y;y0),\\nwhich reportedly yields better performance. Finally, [McA07] recently sug-\\ngested generic functions \\x00( y;y0).\\nThe logistic loss can also be interpreted as the negative log-likelihood of\\na conditional exponential family model:\\np(yjx;w) := exp(hw;\\x1e(x;y)i\\x00g(wjx)); (3.7)\\nwhere the normalizing constant g(wjx), often called the log-partition func-\\ntion, reads\\ng(wjx) := logX\\ny02Yexp\\x00\\nw;\\x1e(x;y0)\\x0b\\x01\\n: (3.8)A3.1 Loss Functions 207\\nAs a consequence of the Hammersley-Cli\\x0bord theorem [Jor08] every expo-\\nnential family distribution corresponds to a undirected graphical model. In\\nour case this implies that the labels yfactorize according to an undirected\\ngraphical model. A large number of problems have been addressed by this\\nsetting, amongst them named entity tagging [LMP01], sequence alignment\\n[TJHA05], segmentation [RSS+07] and path planning [RBZ06]. It is clearly\\nimpossible to give examples of all settings in this section, nor would a brief\\nsummary do this \\x0celd any justice. We therefore refer the reader to the edited\\nvolume [BHS+07] and the references therein.\\nIf the underlying graphical model is tractable then e\\x0ecient inference al-\\ngorithms based on dynamic programming can be used to compute (3.5) and\\n(3.6). We discuss intractable graphical models in Section A3.1.2.1, and now\\nturn our attention to the derivatives of the above structured losses.\\nWhen it comes to computing derivatives of the logistic loss, (3.5), we have\\n@wl(x;y;w ) =P\\ny0\\x1e(x;y0) exphw;\\x1e(x;y0)iP\\ny0exphw;\\x1e(x;y0)i\\x00\\x1e(x;y) (3.9)\\n=Ey0\\x18p(y0jx)\\x02\\n\\x1e(x;y0)\\x03\\n\\x00\\x1e(x;y): (3.10)\\nwherep(yjx) is the exponential family model (3.7). In the case of (3.6) we\\ndenote by \\x16y(x) the argmax of the RHS, that is\\n\\x16y(x) := argmax\\ny0\\x00(y;y0)\\nw;\\x1e(x;y0)\\x00\\x1e(x;y)\\x0b\\n+ \\x01(y;y0): (3.11)\\nThis allows us to compute the derivative of l(x;y;w ) as\\n@wl(x;y;w ) = \\x00(y;\\x16y(x)) [\\x1e(x;\\x16y(x))\\x00\\x1e(x;y)]: (3.12)\\nIn the case where the loss is maximized for more than one distinct value \\x16 y(x)\\nwe may average over the individual values, since any convex combination of\\nsuch terms lies in the subdi\\x0berential.\\nNote that (3.6) majorizes \\x01( y;y\\x03), wherey\\x03:= argmaxy0hw;\\x1e(x;y0)i\\n[TJHA05]. This can be seen via the following series of inequalities:\\n\\x01(y;y\\x03)\\x14\\x00(y;y\\x03)hw;\\x1e(x;y\\x03)\\x00\\x1e(x;y)i+ \\x01(y;y\\x03)\\x14l(x;y;w ):\\nThe \\x0crst inequality follows because \\x00( y;y\\x03)\\x150 andy\\x03maximizeshw;\\x1e(x;y0)i\\nthus implying that \\x00( y;y\\x03)hw;\\x1e(x;y\\x03)\\x00\\x1e(x;y)i\\x150. The second inequal-\\nity follows by de\\x0cnition of the loss.\\nWe conclude this section with a simple lemma which is at the heart of\\nseveral derivations of [Joa05]. While the proof in the original paper is far\\nfrom trivial, it is straightforward in our setting:208 3 Loss Functions\\nLemma 3.1 Denote by\\x0e(y;y0)a loss and let \\x1e(xi;yi)be a feature map for\\nobservations (xi;yi)with 1\\x14i\\x14m. Moreover, denote by X;Y the set of\\nallmpatterns and labels respectively. Finally let\\n\\x08(X;Y ) :=mX\\ni=1\\x1e(xi;yi)and\\x01(Y;Y0) :=mX\\ni=1\\x0e(yi;y0\\ni): (3.13)\\nThen the following two losses are equivalent:\\nmX\\ni=1max\\ny0\\nw;\\x1e(xi;y0)\\x00\\x1e(xi;yi)\\x0b\\n+\\x0e(yi;y0)and max\\nY0\\nw;\\x08(X;Y0)\\x00\\x08(X;Y )\\x0b\\n+ \\x01(Y;Y0):\\nThis is immediately obvious, since both feature map and loss decompose,\\nwhich allows us to perform maximization over Y0by maximizing each of its\\nmcomponents. In doing so, we showed that aggregating all data and labels\\ninto a single feature map and loss yields results identical to minimizing\\nthe sum over all individual losses. This holds, in particular, for the sample\\nerror loss of [Joa05]. Also note that this equivalence does nothold whenever\\n\\x00(y;y0) is not constant.\\nA3.1.2.1 Intractable Models\\nWe now discuss cases where computing l(x;y;w ) itself is too expensive. For\\ninstance, for intractable graphical models, the computation ofP\\nyexphw;\\x1e(x;y)i\\ncannot be computed e\\x0eciently. [WJ03] propose the use of a convex majoriza-\\ntion of the log-partition function in those cases. In our setting this means\\nthat instead of dealing with\\nl(x;y;w ) =g(wjx)\\x00hw;\\x1e(x;y)iwhereg(wjx) := logX\\nyexphw;\\x1e(x;y)i\\n(3.14)\\none uses a more easily computable convex upper bound on gvia\\nsup\\n\\x162MARG(x)hw;\\x16i+HGauss (\\x16jx): (3.15)\\nHere MARG( x) is an outer bound on the conditional marginal polytope\\nassociated with the map \\x1e(x;y). Moreover, HGauss (\\x16jx) is an upper bound\\non the entropy by using a Gaussian with identical variance. More re\\x0cned\\ntree decompositions exist, too. The key bene\\x0ct of our approach is that the\\nsolution\\x16of the optimization problem (3.15) can immediately be used as a\\ngradient of the upper bound. This is computationally rather e\\x0ecient.A3.1 Loss Functions 209\\nLikewise note that [TGK04] use relaxations when solving structured esti-\\nmation problems of the form\\nl(x;y;w ) = max\\ny0\\x00(y;y0)\\nw;\\x1e(x;y0)\\x00\\x1e(x;y)\\x0b\\n+ \\x01(y;y0); (3.16)\\nby enlarging the domain of maximization with respect to y0. For instance,\\ninstead of an integer programming problem we might relax the setting to\\na linear program which is much cheaper to solve. This, again, provides an\\nupper bound on the original loss function.\\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that convex relaxation strategies are\\nwell applicable for bundle methods. In fact, the results of the corresponding\\noptimization procedures can be used directly for further optimization steps.\\nA3.1.3 Scalar Multivariate Performance Scores\\nWe now discuss a series of structured loss functions and how they can be\\nimplemented e\\x0eciently. For the sake of completeness, we give a concise rep-\\nresentation of previous work on multivariate performance scores and ranking\\nmethods. All these loss functions rely on having access to hw;xi, which can\\nbe computed e\\x0eciently by using the same operations as in Section A3.1.1.\\nA3.1.3.1 ROC Score\\nDenote by f=Xwthe vector of function values on the training set. It is\\nwell known that the area under the ROC curve is given by\\nAUC(x;y;w ) =1\\nm+m\\x00X\\nyi<yjI(hw;xii<hw;xji); (3.17)\\nwherem+andm\\x00are the numbers of positive and negative observations\\nrespectively, and I(\\x01) is indicator function. Directly optimizing the cost 1 \\x00\\nAUC(x;y;w ) is di\\x0ecult as it is not continuous in w. By using max(0 ;1 +\\nhw;xi\\x00xji) as the surrogate loss function for all pairs ( i;j) for whichyi<yj\\nwe have the following convex multivariate empirical risk\\nRemp(w) =1\\nm+m\\x00X\\nyi<yjmax(0;1 +hw;xi\\x00xji) =1\\nm+m\\x00X\\nyi<yjmax(0;1 +fi\\x00fj):\\n(3.18)\\nObviously, we could compute Remp(w) and its derivative by an O(m2) op-\\neration. However [Joa05] showed that both can be computed in O(mlogm)\\ntime using a sorting operation, which we now describe.\\nDenote byc=f\\x001\\n2yan auxiliary variable and let iandjbe indices such210 3 Loss Functions\\nAlgorithm 3.2 ROCScore( X;y;w )\\n1:input: Feature matrix X, labelsy, and weight vector w\\n2:initialization: s\\x00=m\\x00ands+= 0 andl=0mandc=Xw\\x001\\n2y\\n3:\\x19 f1;:::;mgsorted in ascending order of c\\n4:fori= 1tomdo\\n5:ify\\x19i=\\x001then\\n6:l\\x19i s+ands\\x00 s\\x00\\x001\\n7:else\\n8:l\\x19i \\x00s\\x00ands+ s++ 1\\n9:end if\\n10:end for\\n11:Rescalel l=(m+m\\x00) and compute r=hl;ciandg=l>X.\\n12:return Riskrand subgradient g\\nthatyi=\\x001 andyj= 1. It follows that ci\\x00cj= 1 +fi\\x00fj. The e\\x0ecient\\nalgorithm is due to the observation that there are at most mdistinct terms\\nck; k= 1;:::;m , each with di\\x0berent frequency lkand sign, appear in (3.18).\\nThese frequencies lkcan be determined by \\x0crst sorting cin ascending order\\nthen scanning through the labels according to the sorted order of cand\\nkeeping running statistics such as the number s\\x00of negative labels yet to\\nencounter, and the number s+of positive labels encountered.

Algorithm 3.2 spells out explicitly how\\nto compute Remp(w) and its subgradient.\\nA3.1.3.2 Ordinal Regression\\nEssentially the same preference relationships need to hold for ordinal re-\\ngression. The only di\\x0berence is that yineed not take on binary values any\\nmore. Instead, we may have an arbitrary number of di\\x0berent values yi(e.g.,\\n1 corresponding to \\'strong reject\\' up to 10 corresponding to \\'strong accept\\',\\nwhen it comes to ranking papers for a conference). That is, we now have\\nyi2f1;:::;ngrather than yi2f\\x06 1g. Our goal is to \\x0cnd some wsuch that\\nhw;xi\\x00xji<0 whenever yi< yj. Whenever this relationship is not satis-\\n\\x0ced, we incur a cost C(yi;yj) for preferring xitoxj. For examples, C(yi;yj)\\ncould be constant i.e.,C(yi;yj) = 1 [Joa06] or linear i.e.,C(yi;yj) =yj\\x00yi.\\nDenote by mithe number of xjfor whichyj=i. In this case, there are\\n\\x16M=m2\\x00Pn\\ni=1m2\\nipairs (yi;yj) for which yi6=yj; this implies that there\\nareM=\\x16M=2 pairs (yi;yj) such that yi< yj. Normalizing by the totalA3.1 Loss Functions 211\\nnumber of comparisons we may write the overall cost of the estimator as\\n1\\nMX\\nyi<yjC(yi;yj)I(hw;xii>hw;xji) whereM=1\\n2\"\\nm2\\x00nX\\nim2\\ni#\\n:(3.19)\\nUsing the same convex majorization as above when we were maximizing the\\nROC score, we obtain an empirical risk of the form\\nRemp(w) =1\\nMX\\nyi<yjC(yi;yj) max(0;1 +hw;xi\\x00xji) (3.20)\\nNow the goal is to \\x0cnd an e\\x0ecient algorithm for obtaining the number of\\ntimes when the individual losses are nonzero such as to compute both the\\nvalue and the gradient of Remp(w). The complication arises from the fact\\nthat observations xiwith labelyimay appear in either side of the inequality\\ndepending on whether yj< yioryj> yi. This problem can be solved as\\nfollows: sort f=Xwin ascending order and traverse it while keeping track\\nof how many items with a lower value yjare no more than 1 apart in terms\\nof their value of fi. This way we may compute the count statistics e\\x0eciently.\\nAlgorithm 3.3 describes the details, generalizing the results of [Joa06]. Again,\\nits runtime is O(mlogm), thus allowing for e\\x0ecient computation.\\nA3.1.3.3 Preference Relations\\nIn general, our loss may be described by means of a set of preference relations\\nj\\x17ifor arbitrary pairs ( i;j)2f1;:::mg2associated with a cost C(i;j)\\nwhich is incurred whenever iis ranked above j. This set of preferences may\\nor may not form a partial or a total order on the domain of all observations.\\nIn these cases e\\x0ecient computations along the lines of Algorithm 3.3 exist.\\nIn general, this is not the case and we need to rely on the fact that the set\\nPcontaining all preferences is su\\x0eciently small that it can be enumerated\\ne\\x0eciently.

Examples are criteria such as Normalized Discounted\\nCumulative Gain (NDCG) ,Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) ,Precision@n , or\\nExpected Rank Utility (ERU) . They are used to address the issue of evaluat-\\ning rankers, search engines or recommender sytems [Voo01, JK02, BHK98,\\nBH04]. For instance, in webpage ranking only the \\x0crst kretrieved docu-\\nments that matter, since users are unlikely to look beyond the \\x0crst k, say\\n10, retrieved webpages in an internet search. [LS07] show that these scores\\ncan be optimized directly by minimizing the following loss:\\nl(X;y;w ) = max\\n\\x19X\\nici\\nw;x\\x19(i)\\x00xi\\x0b\\n+ha\\x00a(\\x19);b(y)i: (3.24)\\nHereciis a monotonically decreasing sequence, the documents are assumed\\nto be arranged in order of decreasing relevance, \\x19is a permutation, the\\nvectorsaandb(y) depend on the choice of a particular ranking measure, and\\na(\\x19) denotes the permutation of aaccording to \\x19.

Finding the\\npermutation maximizing c>f(\\x19)\\x00a(\\x19)>b(y) is a linear assignment problem\\nwhich can be easily solved by the Hungarian Marriage algorithm, that is,\\nthe Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.\\nThe original papers by [Kuh55] and [Mun57] implied an algorithm with\\nO(m3) cost in the number of terms. Later, [Kar80] suggested an algorithm\\nwith expected quadratic time in the size of the assignment problem (ignor-\\ning log-factors). Finally, [OL93] propose a linear time algorithm for large\\nproblems. Since in our case the number of pages is fairly small (in the order\\nof 50 to 200 per query ) the scaling behavior per query is not too important.\\nWe used an existing implementation due to [JV87].\\nNote also that training sets consist of a collection of ranking problems,\\nthat is, we have several ranking problems of size 50 to 200. By means of\\nparallelization we are able to distribute the work onto a cluster of worksta-\\ntions, which is able to overcome the issue of the rather costly computation\\nper collection of queries. Algorithm 3.5 spells out the steps in detail.\\nA3.1.3.5 Contingency Table Scores\\n[Joa05] observed that F\\x0cscores and related quantities dependent on a con-\\ntingency table can also be computed e\\x0eciently by means of structured es-\\ntimation. Such scores depend in general on the number of true and false\\npositives and negatives alike. Algorithm 3.6 shows how a corresponding em-\\npirical risk and subgradient can be computed e\\x0eciently. As with the pre-\\nvious losses, here again we use convex majorization to obtain a tractable\\noptimization problem.A3.1 Loss Functions 215\\nGiven a set of labels yand an estimate y0, the numbers of true positives\\n(T+), true negatives ( T\\x00), false positives ( F+), and false negatives ( F\\x00) are\\ndetermined according to a contingency table as follows:\\ny>0y<0\\ny0>0T+F+\\ny0<0F\\x00T\\x00\\nIn the sequel, we denote by m+=T++F\\x00andm\\x00=T\\x00+F+the numbers\\nof positives and negative labels in y, respectively. We note that F\\x0cscore can\\nbe computed based on the contingency table [Joa05] as\\nF\\x0c(T+;T\\x00) =(1 +\\x0c2)T+\\nT++m\\x00\\x00T\\x00+\\x0c2m+: (3.27)\\nIf we want to usehw;xiito estimate the label of observation xi, we may use\\nthe following structured loss to \\\\directly\" optimize w.r.t.

Since \\x01 does not depend on the speci\\x0cc choice of ( y;y0)\\nbut rather just on which sets they disagree, lcan be maximized as follows:\\nEnumerating all possible m+m\\x00contingency tables in a way such that given\\na con\\x0cguration ( T+;T\\x00),T+(T\\x00) positive (negative) observations xiwith\\nlargest (lowest) value of hw;xiiare labeled as positive (negative). This is\\ne\\x0bectively implemented as a nested loop hence run in O(m2) time. Algorithm\\n3.6 describes the procedure in details.\\nA3.1.4 Vector Loss Functions\\nNext we discuss \\\\vector\" loss functions, i.e.,functions where wis best de-\\nscribed as a matrix (denoted by W) and the loss depends on Wx. Here, we\\nhave feature vector x2Rd, labely2Rk, and weight matrix W2Rd\\x02k. We\\nalso denote feature matrix X2Rm\\x02das a matrix of mfeature vectors xi,\\nand stack up the columns WiofWas a vector w.\\nSome of the most relevant cases are multiclass classi\\x0ccation using both\\nthe exponential families model and structured estimation, hierarchical mod-\\nels,i.e., ontologies, and multivariate regression.

In this case it is clear that by pre-computing XW subsequent calcu-\\nlations of the loss and its gradient are signi\\x0ccantly accelerated.\\nA second class of important losses is given by plain multiclass classi\\x0ccation\\nproblems, e.g., recognizing digits of a postal code or categorizing high-level\\ndocument categories. In this case, \\x1e(x;y) is best represented by ey\\nx(using\\na linear model). Clearly we may view hw;\\x1e(x;y)ias an operation which\\nchooses a column indexed by yfromxW, since all labels ycorrespond to\\na di\\x0berent weight vector Wy. Formally we set hw;\\x1e(x;y)i= [xW]y. In this\\ncase, structured estimation losses can be rewritten as\\nl(x;y;W ) = max\\ny0\\x00(y;y0)\\nWy0\\x00Wy;x\\x0b\\n+ \\x01(y;y0) (3.29)\\nand@Wl(x;y;W ) = \\x00(y;y\\x03)(ey\\x03\\x00ey)\\nx: (3.30)\\nHere \\x00 and \\x01 are de\\x0cned as in Section A3.1.2 and y\\x03denotes the value of y0A3.1 Loss Functions 217\\nfor which the RHS of (3.29) is maximized. This means that for unstructured\\nmulticlass settings we may simply compute xW. Since this needs to be per-\\nformed for all observations xiwe may take advantage of fast linear algebra\\nroutines and compute f=XW for e\\x0eciency. Likewise note that comput-\\ning the gradient over mobservations is now a matrix-matrix multiplication,\\ntoo: denote by Gthe matrix of rows of gradients \\x00( yi;y\\x03\\ni)(ey\\x03\\ni\\x00eyi). Then\\n@WRemp(X;y;W ) =G>X. Note that Gis very sparse with at most two\\nnonzero entries per row, which makes the computation of G>Xessentially\\nas expensive as two matrix vector multiplications. Whenever we have many\\nclasses, this may yield signi\\x0ccant computational gains.\\nLog-likelihood scores of exponential families share similar expansions. We\\nhave\\nl(x;y;W ) = logX\\ny0exp\\nw;\\x1e(x;y0)\\x0b\\n\\x00hw;\\x1e(x;y)i= logX\\ny0exp\\nWy0;x\\x0b\\n\\x00hWy;xi\\n(3.31)\\n@Wl(x;y;W ) =P\\ny0(ey0\\nx) exp\\nWy0;x\\x0b\\nP\\ny0exp\\nWy0;x\\x0b\\x00ey\\nx: (3.32)\\nThe main di\\x0berence to the soft-margin setting is that the gradients are\\nnotsparse in the number of classes. This means that the computation of\\ngradients is slightly more costly.\\nA3.1.4.2 Ontologies\\nFig. A3.1. Two ontologies. Left: a binary hierarchy with internal nodes f1;:::; 7g\\nand labelsf8;:::15g.Right: a generic directed acyclic graph with internal nodes\\nf1;:::; 6;12gand labelsf7;:::; 11;13;:::; 15g. Note that node 5 has two parents,\\nnamely nodes 2 and 3. Moreover, the labels need not be found at the same level of\\nthe tree: nodes 14 and 15 are one level lower than the rest of the nodes.\\nAssume that the labels we want to estimate can be found to belong to\\na directed acyclic graph. For instance, this may be a gene-ontology graph218 3 Loss Functions\\n[ABB+00] a patent hierarchy [CH04], or a genealogy. In these cases we have a\\nhierarchy of categories to which an element xmay belong. Figure A3.1 gives\\ntwo examples of such directed acyclic graphs (DAG). The \\x0crst example is\\na binary tree, while the second contains nodes with di\\x0berent numbers of\\nchildren ( e.g., node 4 and 12), nodes at di\\x0berent levels having children ( e.g.,\\nnodes 5 and 12), and nodes which have more than one parent ( e.g., node 5).\\nIt is a well known fundamental property of trees that they have at most as\\nmany internal nodes as they have leaf nodes.\\nIt is now our goal to build a classi\\x0cer which is able to categorize observa-\\ntions according to which leaf node they belong to (each leaf node is assigned\\na labely). Denote by k+ 1 the number of nodes in the DAG including the\\nroot node. In this case we may design a feature map \\x1e(y)2Rk[CH04] by\\nassociating with every label ythe vector describing the path from the root\\nnode toy, ignoring the root node itself. For instance, for the \\x0crst DAG in\\nFigure A3.1 we have\\n\\x1e(8) = (1;0;1;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0) and\\x1e(13) = (0;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0)\\nWhenever several paths are admissible, as in the right DAG of Figure A3.1\\nwe average over all possible paths. For example, we have\\n\\x1e(10) = (0:5;0:5;0;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0) and\\x1e(15) = (0;1;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;1):\\nAlso note that the lengths of the paths need not be the same ( e.g., to\\nreach 15 it takes a longer path than to reach 13). Likewise, it is natural to\\nassume that \\x01( y;y0),i.e.,the cost for mislabeling yasy0will depend on the\\nsimilarity of the path. In other words, it is likely that the cost for placing\\nxinto the wrong sub-sub-category is less than getting the main category of\\nthe object wrong.\\nTo complete the setting, note that for \\x1e(x;y) =\\x1e(y)\\nxthe cost of\\ncomputing all labels is kinner products, since the value of hw;\\x1e(x;y)ifor a\\nparticularycan be obtained by the sum of the contributions for the segments\\nof the path. This means that the values for allterms can be computed by\\na simple breadth \\x0crst traversal through the graph. As before, we may make\\nuse of vectorization in our approach, since we may compute xW2Rkto\\nobtain the contributions on all segments of the DAG before performing the\\ngraph traversal. Since we have mpatternsxiwe may vectorize matters by\\npre-computing XW.\\nAlso note that \\x1e(y)\\x00\\x1e(y0) is nonzero only for those edges where the paths\\nforyandy0di\\x0ber. Hence we only change weights on those parts of the graph\\nwhere the categorization di\\x0bers. Algorithm 3.7 describes the subgradient and\\nloss computation for the soft-margin type of loss function.A3.1 Loss Functions 219\\nAlgorithm 3.7 Ontology(X;y;W )\\n1:input: Feature matrix X2Rm\\x02d, labelsy, and weight matrix W2\\nRd\\x02k\\n2:initialization: G=02Rm\\x02kandr= 0\\n3:Computef=XW and letfi=xiW\\n4:fori= 1tomdo\\n5: LetDibe the DAG with edges annotated with the values of fi\\n6: TraverseDito \\x0cnd node y\\x03that maximize sum of fivalues on the\\npath plus \\x01( yi;y0)\\n7:Gi=\\x1e(y\\x03)\\x00\\x1e(yi)\\n8:r r+zy\\x03\\x00zyi\\n9:end for\\n10:g=G>X\\n11:return Riskrand subgradient g\\nThe same reasoning applies to estimation when using an exponential fam-\\nilies model. The only di\\x0berence is that we need to compute a soft-max\\nover paths rather than exclusively choosing the best path over the ontol-\\nogy. Again, a breadth-\\x0crst recursion su\\x0eces: each of the leaves yof the\\nDAG is associated with a probability p(yjx). To obtain Ey\\x18p(yjx)[\\x1e(y)] all\\nwe need to do is perform a bottom-up traversal of the DAG summing over\\nall probability weights on the path. Wherever a node has more than one\\nparent, we distribute the probability weight equally over its parents.Bibliography\\n[ABB+00] M. Ashburner, C. A. Ball, J. A. Blake, D. Botstein, H. Butler, J.

That is, given the photo (or video recording) of a\\nperson, recognize who this person is. In other words, the system needs to\\nclassify the faces into one of many categories (Alice, Bob, Charlie, . . . ) or\\ndecide that it is an unknown face. A similar, yet conceptually quite di\\x0berent\\nproblem is that of veri\\x0ccation. Here the goal is to verify whether the person\\nin question is who he claims to be. Note that di\\x0berently to before, this\\nis now a yes/no question. To deal with di\\x0berent lighting conditions, facial\\nexpressions, whether a person is wearing glasses, hairstyle, etc., it is desirable\\nto have a system which learns which features are relevant for identifying a\\nperson.',\n",

              " 'An excellent overview for the adv. undergrad or beg. grad,September 30, 2002By Todd Ebert (Long Beach California) - See all my reviewsThis review is from: Machine Learning (Hardcover)I agree with some of the previous reviews which criticize the book for its lack ofdepth, but I believe this to be an asset rather than a liability given its targetaudience (seniors and beginning grad. students). The average college senior typicallyknows very little about subjects like neural networks, genetic algorithms, or Baysiannetworks, and this book goes a long way in demystifying these subjects in a veryclear, concise, and understandable way. Moreover, the first-year grad. student who isinterested in possibly doing research in this field needs more of an overview than todive deeply into one of the many branches which themselves have had entire books written aboutthem. This is one of the few if only books where one will find diverse areas oflearning (e.g. analytical, reinforcment, Bayesian, neural-network, genetic-algorithmic)all within the same cover.But more than just an encyclopedic introduction, the author makes a number ofconnections between the different paradigms. For example, he explains thatassociated with each paradigm is the notion of an inductive-learning bias, i.e. theunderlying assumptions that lend validity to a given learning approach. These end-of-chapter discussions on bias seem very interesting and unique to this book.Finally, I used this book for part of the reading material for an intro. AI class, andreceived much positive feedback from the students, although some did find thepresentation a bit too abstract for their undergraduate tastes',\n",

              " \"Venerable, in both senses, April 4, 2004By eldil (Albuquerque NM) - See all my reviewsThis review is from: Machine Learning (Hardcover)It's pretty well done, it covers theory and core areas but - maybe it was more thestate of the field when it was written - I found it unsatisfyingly un-synthesized,unconnected, and short of detail (but this is subjective). I found the 2nd edition ofRussell and Norvig to be a better introduction where it covers the same topic, whichit does for everything I can think of, except VC dimension.The book sorely needs an update, it was written in 1997 and the field has movedfast. A comparison with Mitchell's current course (materials generously availableonline) shows that about 1/4 of the topics taught have arisen since the book waspublished; Boosting, Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov Models to namethe best-known. The book also does not cover statistical or data mining methods.Despite the subjective complaint about lack of depth it does give the theoreticalroots and many fundamental techniques decently and readably. For many purposesthough it may have been superceded by R&N 2nd ed.\",\n",
